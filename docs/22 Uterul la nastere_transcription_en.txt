Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you again for the lesson about the uterus. Today, I will talk to you about the emotional significance of the uterus, because yes, it is not only a physiological organ responsible for reproduction, but it also carries emotional meanings. We will also have a short illustrated anatomy lesson to remind ourselves where it is located, what it looks like, what it does, and so on. Because your uterus will be the perfect nest for your child. We will talk about what the uterus looks like at the beginning of pregnancy, its size before pregnancy, and during menstruation. We will discuss the retroverted uterus, because you have probably heard many times from doctors: “Oh my, we have a retroverted uterus here!” Nothing to worry about. We will talk about other uterine shapes, because the uterus can have different forms. And again, we will touch on some emotional aspects. I will show you the journey of the fertilized egg to the uterus. I will show you how your organs arrange themselves during pregnancy, from the start until the end. We will talk about painful areas during pregnancy, about the growth and stretching of uterine muscles during pregnancy, and I will show you what the uterus looks like and what types of muscles it contains.

Alright, let’s begin. Please get something to write with and let’s see what the uterus is. The uterus signifies not only the home of your baby, but it is also the home and shelter we received when we came into this world. To find out how welcomed your baby feels in your womb, ask yourself now: how comfortable do you feel at home? And give yourself an honest, real, true answer, because, you see, you cannot fool your mind. If you feel good in your body and if you feel good at home, it means your uterus will also be a welcoming one, and your baby will love to nestle in your uterus. There are many women, and we go through many phases in life, when there are moments we don’t feel at home, when we can’t find our place, and then the place in the uterus will also be occupied. Because if we can’t find our place, neither will the child find their place in us. These things are emotional in nature, but they are very important and are part of exploring yourself, your memories, the sensations you experience and transmit to your child.

The pregnant woman’s body is fascinating, which is why this subject has fascinated me for so many years, and I am glad you have chosen to find out what your wonderful body is capable of. Let’s see what the uterus looks like. First of all, down here we have the vagina, which ends where the uterus begins. This part is called the cervix. The cervix is the entrance to the uterus. The uterus is shaped like a fruit, a pear, turned upside down, and inside the uterus we have the myometrium and the endometrium. This endometrium, which is all around, is like a cavity. It is, let’s say, the protective layer that will nest the baby after the egg is fertilized. This endometrium, which you have surely heard of, is shed with every menstrual cycle. So, when we are not pregnant, this endometrium is lost during the cycle. Let me tell you a secret. When you have been wanting a child for a long time and it hasn’t happened yet, and with every cycle you keep thinking more and more about wanting a child, and you are working on it, and it becomes a stress, know that your endometrium has received the message and you know what it does? It will thicken, it will produce more tissue, precisely so as not to lose any early pregnancy, meaning any egg that comes from here… which will be fertilized somewhere in the tube and will travel and reach the uterus on the seventh day and will be embedded somewhere on this wall or that wall. Because we have two ovaries that release eggs every month, which then travel through the tube to the uterus. So, if this child you are now carrying in your womb was a child you waited for and wanted very much, and you worked for it—yes, so to speak. I hope it wasn’t just work, but also pleasure, because it matters enormously that your baby comes from a place of love and not of force. Your endometrium will be much thicker. And then there is the possibility that after you become pregnant, even if you are pregnant, you may experience some bleeding. Bleeding that actually cleans out the extra endometrium that developed as a result of your desire to keep a baby at any cost. So, a thicker endometrium due to longing can be shed as a kind of period during pregnancy, in the case of a much-awaited, much-desired child.

Alright. With that said, let’s move on to the tube. The tubes are on the left and right, and the tube, which looks like a flower, embraces the ovary—each one—from which, every month, approximately, we believe, every twenty-eight days, an egg is released from the ovarian reserve. Good, I think that’s clear. What you see here, these white things, are ligaments. Here we have ligaments. For example, this ligament holds the ovary, this ligament holds the uterus in place. This ligament maintains, meaning they are like strings anchored in our body so that everything stays where it should. Good. We will talk about ligaments soon, that’s why I mentioned them. The uterus is the soft and warm nest for your baby during the nine months of pregnancy. If we look at this image, it looks like a little monster with two eyes. Those are the ovaries. Down here we have the vagina. Here is the cervix, which keeps the uterus sealed during pregnancy. Here the baby will develop. You see, the endometrium is this upper layer, meaning the inner layer of the uterus, which, if we are not pregnant, is lost and shed with the next menstruation. I forgot to tell you that the tubes, so you can imagine how thick they are, are about the size of a spaghetti noodle. Everyone has eaten spaghetti. Now, there are Romanian spaghetti and Italian spaghetti. Italian spaghetti are eaten al dente, meaning they are not boiled until they fall apart or swell up, yes? So, when we look at the tubes, we should think of an al dente cooked spaghetti, not an overcooked, swollen Romanian macaroni. It’s very important to understand, so you can get an idea of how thick the tube is.

Good. The uterus at the beginning of pregnancy is about the size of an avocado. Now, of course, there are normal avocados and XXL avocados. Think of a normal avocado, about the size of your fist, also pear-shaped. So, our uterus is about the size of a fist or an avocado at the start of pregnancy. Let’s see what the uterus looks like during menstruation, before pregnancy. And, as you can see, before pregnancy, it doubles in capacity. Let’s say this is a normal avocado, and this is what the uterus looks like during menstruation. So, this is how we function before and after pregnancy.

Now, the story of the retroverted uterus. Who hasn’t been scared by this myth or threat? Everyone. Let’s see what a retroverted uterus means. Good. Anatomy. The vagina, the entrance to the vagina. Here we have the anus and colon. Here we have the vagina leading to the cervix and uterus. The uterus here is a bit more inclined toward the bladder. Here we have a bone. The pubic bone, so the uterus here. This is considered the normal position. Good, and now, who hasn’t heard the story: “Oh, you have a retroverted uterus, you might never get pregnant!” Yes, I believed this story too, and I didn’t know what it meant. I thought maybe it was further back, or… Yes, the uterus is a bit further back, but otherwise, know that sperm, if present, reaches the uterus, the tubes, and the egg just as well. So, it is a myth that if your uterus tilts backward instead of forward, there is a problem. Please, get it out of your head that you have a problem because of your retroverted uterus.

Now let’s see what other uterine shapes exist in this wide world. Now we have the normal uterus. Yes, we have the vagina, the cervix. You see the upside-down pear, the uterus with the endometrium, and this is a normal uterus. This is a didelphys uterus, which has, let’s say, split in two, because emotionally speaking, something about the idea of motherhood has split in two. Emotionally speaking, the uterus can have various malformations as a consequence of different transgenerational emotional traumas. So, this didelphys, which is split in two as if there are two uteri, is an anomaly, but it certainly has a story behind it, an emotional story. If it’s not transgenerational, it may be from this generation, with a very intense childhood. There is also the arcuate uterus. You see, the only anomaly is that at the top, it looks like an arch. You can see it. Yes? This one shot with a bow. Then we have a bicornuate and unicornuate uterus. Unicornuate means there is no connection to the second tube. It’s as if the second tube is somewhere around here, but it’s not functional. So, we have an ovary that will never function, or it functions, but doesn’t reach the uterus. So, we have just one unicorn here. There is a bicornuate uterus, which resembles the didelphys, but the separation is not as pronounced, and the septate uterus, which is so deeply divided that it is effectively split in two. Here, it is important to see if you have atypical uteri and where these transgenerational inheritances that have deformed your uterus come from. I have had a few women whose childhood stories matched perfectly with a septate uterus. Or, um, (sighs), septate is the only one I have encountered. Yes, the septate uterus.

Good. Look, what do you think this is? This is a tube and this is the ovary. Only, no, the tube is sectioned. And just so you know, this is about the size of a spaghetti noodle, so everything is that fine and tiny. I just wanted to show you with this picture that nature creates perfection, and the ovary is the place where the potential for life resides. Regarding those infertility diagnoses about increased or decreased ovarian reserve, know that all are emotionally conditioned. Look at this absolutely beautiful picture, which I have used in many of my posts. This is the tube. It is exactly this end, which has that flower-like texture that tenderly embraces the ovary. How beautifully our body is created and how perfect everything is!

Now let’s see what the egg looks like and what happens in the supreme act of creation of life. The egg allows only one sperm to enter the sanctuary. So, even if there are two hundred and fifty million sperm in an ejaculation, some get lost along the way, some go up one tube, others the other. Only one is allowed to pass. Even though the competition is fierce, I want to tell you that the single sperm that manages to enter the egg does not do so because it brought a bigger shovel or pickaxe, but simply because the egg allows that sperm to enter. Why? The egg has an impenetrable shell. But when it chooses the sperm, it will (laughs) soften that impenetrable shell exactly where the sperm is supposed to enter. So, it won’t be in seven places, only in one, and only where the egg wants. So, you see, nothing is random, everything is chosen. The egg chooses the sperm that will enter.

Now, here we see the ovary, the tube, the uterus, the cervix, and the entrance to the uterus. Below is the vagina. Now, the ovary releases an egg. Around this area, it meets the 250 million or so sperm. And ovulation happens. Sorry, fertilization happens. We have the zygote, after which the fertilized egg starts to roll, and I’ll show you on some very fine hairs inside the tubes, which help roll it along the way to the uterus. And cell division occurs. We have four, eight, sixteen cells. The morula, this is on day four, then the blastocyst on days five and six, and the implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium. This is what it looks like when it implants in the endometrial wall. This is, let’s say, the nest it makes, and the endometrium, as I told you, thickens to catch that fertilized egg.

Now let’s see how the organs rearrange themselves in a pregnant woman’s body. We start with the vagina. Nothing changes in the vagina, only during birth. The vagina is this thin part. Nothing changes in the anus and colon either, but it will change when the baby needs to come out of the belly and will occupy this space, compressing the colon and the bladder to make room to exit through the vagina. The vagina is sufficiently wrinkled to allow stretching for the baby to pass. The uterus, which is very small. The uterus now contains the baby. That’s why the uterus is the most flexible female muscular organ. Let’s continue. The bladder is here, very close to the baby. As the pregnancy progresses, the mother goes to the bathroom more often and urinates just a little. Why? Because the bladder, being compressed, no longer has the same capacity as before. Now, the small intestine is squeezed here. Then we have the transverse colon, which will fold somewhere around here. What do you see here? The pancreas, yes, remains in place. Then we have the stomach, which, as you can see, gets squashed from its normal shape. That’s why you will eat often and in small amounts, because the stomach is reduced. It’s like a stomach reduction, without surgery or interventions that affect other things. Here we have the liver, which used to sit more relaxed, more free. Now it will be a bit more squeezed toward the upper part of the abdomen. So, here you see the baby. The placenta, which is lateral. Usually, know that the placenta never attaches to the outside, but always to the inside, never to the outside of the belly, so never on this side. So, placentas usually position themselves at the top or on the inner side, not toward the outside of the belly, because here the baby will be moving around.

Good, let’s see. The ligaments are what give the pregnant woman the impression that something is stretching in the lower abdomen. These are the ligaments. Here we have ligaments. Here we have ligaments. All these ligaments, as I told you, position the uterus in an upright position. Otherwise, it would not be stable, it would fall back, forward, or get squashed. But because these ligaments hold the uterus, when the uterus starts to grow, these ligaments stretch. That’s why the sensation a pregnant woman has is: “Oh, let me get up more slowly, I feel something pulling.” Yes? The ligaments are stretching. It’s normal. Yes? Absolutely normal. No need to worry. Now, there are areas of possible pain due to the stretching of the ligaments that position the uterus. See here, this area, here, at the bikini line, yes? This shaded area? This is a painful area. When you get up suddenly, when you make quick movements that are not as they should be and not at the right time. Everything needs to be a bit slower, because you will feel something pulling and something not letting you move as you did before.

Now, this is what the uterus looks like in a woman’s belly. Here we have the belly, breasts, and vagina. This is the uterus. Of course, a picture. Yes? Because the uterus grows and actually gives birth to your baby. The uterus is the most flexible and adaptable female muscular organ, because it stretches and allows the body to house a baby inside. It increases 64 times in size during pregnancy, and the ligaments that hold it in position also stretch and give that pulling pain sensation. Good. The baby grows in the womb, in its amniotic sac, and is nourished directly from the placenta through the umbilical cord for 9 months. Let’s see. Here we have the vagina. Here we have the cervix, which must dilate for the baby to be born. Here is the bladder. So, as the baby grows, the bladder will be compressed, and when the baby needs to come out, the colon is also compressed. The baby is already in birth position, with its head down, arms and legs tucked in, and the umbilical cord feeding from the placenta.

At the beginning of the month before birth, you may experience a sensation of shortness of breath. This is because, let’s see, at first the uterus is the size of an avocado or your fist, then at 3 months it starts to grow, at 4 months, at 5 months. Usually, after 5 months, for some women, the belly starts to show. So, don’t worry if until 5 months people just think you’ve gained weight and not that you’re carrying a baby. After 5, 6 months—for example, for me, at 6 months my belly started to show, to really grow, and I looked pregnant, not just like a woman who gained weight. At 7 months, 8 months, and 9 months. When you reach 8 to 9 months, you will feel that your belly has risen so much that when you inhale, you feel like there’s no more room. The diaphragm has also risen, and the lung volume has decreased. That’s why you will feel you can’t breathe as you did before. Please don’t go to the doctor and ask: “Oh my! I have respiratory failure, I don’t know, I can’t breathe, I can’t get enough oxygen.” Don’t worry, it’s absolutely normal. A few weeks before birth, the baby will descend into the pelvis, and you will be able to breathe again, as you did before, feeling that you are getting enough air. So, it is a normal sensation that improves before birth. And by the way, during that period before birth, when you can no longer breathe well, that’s a sign that the end is near. Because the belly of a woman having her first child drops two or three weeks before birth, meaning the baby descends and you have two or three weeks left until delivery. For a woman who has already given birth once, for the second, third, or fifth child, the belly may drop just a few days before birth. So, you will know because there are signs that let you know when the baby is coming.

And now, look: a newborn. Look how it sits and knows how to stay curled up. That’s how it stayed for nine months, with crossed legs, crossed arms, chin to chest. So, how does such a cute and small baby fit in your belly? Believe me, in the most perfect way. That’s why, when they come out and suddenly, from this curled position, they have to sleep stretched out, they won’t feel comfortable. They want to go back to being curled up. That’s why a carried baby will be much happier being carried, because they will feel protected again in a tight space, compared to a big bed, where suddenly there’s so much space and they feel lost in all that emptiness. Look where your baby fits, exactly like this, curled up in the uterus.

Now I want to introduce you to the two types of muscles: the longitudinal uterine muscles and the circular uterine muscles. The longitudinal muscles are denser at the top, and the circular muscles are denser at the bottom. The stem of this pear is already the vagina. The uterus comes up to here, yes? About here. The rest is the vagina, which is very wrinkled. Now, these circular muscles keep the uterus closed, so the baby can grow inside. Only when the time for birth comes will those circular muscles open and allow the baby to slide into the vagina. The longitudinal muscles, which are denser at the top, have the role of pushing the baby down with each contraction, millimeter by millimeter. So, what do the longitudinal muscles do, those from bottom to top? They will pull on the circular muscles to create dilation and will push from above, after pulling up and pushing, they will push the baby millimeter by millimeter toward the exit, after dilation occurs. But I explain this in a separate course about contractions.

So, the baby is in the safest place on earth, meaning in the womb of a confident mother. That’s why it is so important for you to know what is happening to you and your body, so you can get rid of those tensions and fears that are not good for you or your child. So, you are on the right path and you are informing yourself to know what to choose for both of you. The relationship this soul will have with you will be the reference model for all other relationships. That is, just as you teach your child from the womb, even if you think you are not teaching them anything. But through your behavior during those nine months, you are already teaching your child how to relate. So, the state you will have during pregnancy will be the state your baby will have in life. The relationship you will have with your coming baby will be their reference model. That’s how they will behave with everyone else, in all relationships in their life. Imagine the responsibility! You are the first encounter and the primordial relationship in this world for this soul who chose you to be their mother. It is a huge responsibility, and I am glad you are aware of your very important role in bringing this soul into the world. Thank you. (onstorms spiritual button sound)
