Greetings, my dear! I hope your heart is well. My name is Dita Depner, and today we will meet for a course on the correct attachment of the baby to the breast. Why is it so important to have this information? Because breastfeeding will be, let’s say, your number one occupation after birth, for at least two years. That is the recommendation, because during these two years, antibodies and the immune system are effectively transferred from mother to child through breastfeeding. Believe me, breastfeeding is the best transfer of health from mother to child. Let’s see what the baby receives in their first meal, that is, in the first 30 minutes after birth. The baby receives colostrum. This is the first breast milk. And because colostrum is produced in a very small quantity and the baby’s stomach is also very small at first—it holds five milliliters of milk, which is about a level teaspoon—every drop is absolutely precious. And yes, it is normal that when your milk comes in, it is yellow-golden or orange, because that is what colostrum looks like, and it comes in drops, meaning it is concentrated and very little, because colostrum is what will colonize the intestinal tract and stomach with the bacteria that will prepare digestion for the mature breast milk, which comes two or three days later. This does not mean the baby needs supplementation, but only you and the colostrum, which prepares digestion for the breast milk that will come gradually, with each day and each feeding. So every drop of that colostrum is gold and matters enormously. So breastfeed as often as you can, every half hour, because the baby digests that milk from your breast very quickly. Believe me, it is now known: colostrum is, let’s say, liquid gold. It is the superfood for the newborn, and not only does it help the baby build an immune system, but it also gives the baby all sorts of nutrients that help develop not just the brain, but also vision, hearing, the heart, heartbeat—so the entire system. Colostrum is very easily digestible by the baby’s stomach. Colostrum also helps a lot if the baby has jaundice.

So your main concern should be to breastfeed your newborn as often as possible, especially in the first three days after birth, because that’s when jaundice appears, which usually results from the medical interventions administered, which the baby’s liver cannot handle. And so, to eliminate this conjugated bilirubin from the liver, the baby needs to be fed as often and as long as possible. So it’s not that lamp that, as you know, changes the baby’s skin color from yellow to pink—the pink we know is okay—but breastfeeding, which doesn’t just do something at the skin level, but actually helps the baby from the inside, cleansing the liver and helping to metabolize that bilirubin that has accumulated due to, let’s say, things that happened during birth. Over-medicalized births, over-medicalized pregnancies. All these stresses are felt at the liver level by the newborn. But that’s another discussion and not a medical one, but rather an emotional one, about what really happens at birth and how much the birth is disrupted.

So colostrum is the first meal that actually lines, so to speak, the intestinal and stomach walls, so that they are able to digest breast milk from now on. You have to think that until now, your baby has not ingested food, and the stomach has not been active until now. So it needs some enzymes, some oligosaccharides, which will effectively create the stomach microbiome, with the help of which the baby can later digest breast milk. Colostrum contains very high levels—okay, I’m having a lapse—very high amounts of proteins, salts, fats, and vitamins. For complete nutrition. And again, when colostrum is ingested, it will start the baby’s digestion, which helps eliminate meconium, that is, the baby’s first stool. About three days, but I explained this in another video, the baby needs to eliminate all the colostrum until the breast milk passes through the digestive system and is also eliminated. So the first meal is very important. Don’t miss it, because you deprive the child of many important things by giving something other than breast milk, that is, colostrum, at that first meal. If you somehow have the chance or misfortune to have nurses or medical staff tell you, “Dear, don’t you see you have no milk? What’s the point? You’re starving your baby? Let us give formula.” Please remember what I told you and believe me, the most important meal is this colostrum and not the bottle of synthetic milk, because it does not have those oligosaccharides and all those non-nutritive elements that feed the microbiome in the baby’s stomach.

Well, let’s say everything goes as it should. The baby is born and we have the magic hour. I will explain in another video exactly what the magic hour means, and the baby lands during the magic hour, directly on the mother’s belly and calms down instantly, because they know and feel that the place is familiar and will meet the mother’s milk for the first time. And from the breast flows love, from the breast flows nourishment, and an immune system with antibodies also comes from the mother’s milk. Usually, the baby does this crawl automatically, but if there is no patience and understanding from the medical staff, you should place the baby directly at the breast. And yes, unfortunately, usually time is needed for such things, and we are a society that is always racing against the clock, and that’s why we completely lack time, even though it is our right to ask for it. Because if the baby is born and everything is fine, you will still stay at least half a day there, so there is no reason to rush or to rush the baby. But the baby must be placed or must reach the mother’s breast within at least the first half hour after birth.

Why? Because another mechanism starts from there—not just feeding the baby, but also helping the mother to deliver the placenta, which is, yes, the second birth after the baby’s birth. The meeting with the breast is actually the meeting with bliss, because the baby learns to adapt now, in this new world, to a new way of feeding. Until now, the baby was not fed at the breast, but was nourished with nutrients through the umbilical cord, which was directly connected to the placenta. So the baby did not use their own digestion to eat or to feed and grow. So, the first meeting with the mother will be the first meeting with trust. The baby learns to know the mother from the outside. Look at this wonderful picture. The baby actually hugs and touches the breast and sometimes even has that very simple instinct to gently massage the breast, because this stimulates lactation. You know how cats knead and purr and feel good? That’s exactly what the baby does with the breast.

The baby touches and massages it precisely to stimulate lactation. And kittens do the same. When they find the mother cat’s nipple, they start to knead it with their paws to bring the milk more easily. So it’s very interesting how nature finds perfect solutions for survival. And now, why would a baby refuse the breast? A baby only refuses the breast if their first meal was a bottle of formula. Usually, this happens in all cases where the baby does not reach the mother’s breast in the first half hour or hour, but is taken away, washed, rubbed, and so on, and brought back after one, two, six, twelve, twenty-four, thirty hours. And that’s where the saying comes from—it’s a pity this happens—but their first meal was a bottle or a pacifier, but usually a bottle, because that’s how they calm the babies who arrive in the neonatal ward and cry for their mothers. And they receive this bottle just to make them quiet, because otherwise they simply would not stop crying. And now I want you to look at this nipple. No matter how small the hole is, no matter how big the hole is, the idea of a pacifier, bottle, or nipple is that you have to press this rubber with the gums or lips to express the milk from the nipple, and it squirts into the mouth. That’s exactly what happens when a baby who cries desperately for their mother is given, in the neonatal ward, after being washed, rubbed, handled differently than with care and maximum love by their own mother. And please, don’t blame me, I’m not criticizing the neonatal nurses or those who wash the baby.

The idea is that the baby does not need anyone’s hands except those of their parents. That’s the real problem. And a baby, after birth, does not need any neonatal ward, any washing, any bath, any rubbing, any shampooing, but needs to stay in the mother’s arms to be able to “digest,” in quotes, the birth experience and to integrate this experience, which is not at all simple—to be born, right? Because it is the first time the baby changes environment, changes place, changes surroundings, because the environment in which they were contained in the mother changes suddenly and the mother disappears. That’s when the baby is taken and then calmed in the neonatal ward. With what? With something to plug their mouth. It’s as if we ask someone, for example, an adult who is upset and crying, instead of asking, “Hey, what’s wrong? Tell me, talk to me. Let’s see what happened,” we just stick a lollipop or a bottle in their mouth. Because, you know, what’s the difference?

That person will not be satisfied with the treatment. They don’t need their mouth plugged so they stop crying. They need to talk. It’s exactly the same with a baby. The baby does not need food or a bottle to fill their mouth, but needs to calm down and reestablish safety after the sudden and brutal separation from their mother, who kept them alive for nine months. It is the first and most terrible separation, after which we still suffer now, as adults. We are now healing from the fear of abandonment, the fear of loneliness, the fear of being left, which we actually experienced then, for the first time at birth. So it is one of the greatest fears of humans, which, yes, was somehow doubled by this difficult experience of separation from something that kept you alive. A baby without a mother will develop a fear of not being able to survive and will cling at any cost to anything alive. That’s why babies who are taken from their mothers—torn from their mothers, because that’s the correct word—cry without stopping and cannot be comforted.

They would usually calm down if they were in their mother’s arms. But mothers don’t know that they cry for their mother, not from hunger. Babies have enough resources to survive even twenty-four or up to forty-eight hours without food. That doesn’t mean we don’t feed them after birth. Because it is a physiological thing to put your baby to the breast in the first thirty minutes after birth. But what happens in the neonatal ward? They receive the bottle, from which they learn. Why do they learn? Because it is their first encounter with feeding. What does a baby learn when a bottle of formula is stuck in their mouth? They learn that from now on, this is how they will receive something to fill their mouth and probably keep them from being hungry, because it will be, for the first time in their life, that they will feel what it’s like to be hungry. And then, with their first feeding experience, the baby will associate the nipple and this movement of pressing with the gums on the nipple to get the milk into their mouth.

That’s what the baby will learn. They will understand that this is the new way of feeding they must adopt from now on, because it is the reference. Why does a person always learn from the first experience? If their first experience was feeding with a bottle, they will believe that all their life they will receive a bottle. The rest must be unlearned to learn something else. And then let’s say you, as a mother, see your baby—not just see, but they give you the baby for a second, you barely have time to smell or see or enjoy them. And you see them again after twelve hours or six hours, if you’re lucky and someone gives them to you. In those six hours, the baby has been fed at least once. They will have been fed with a bottle of synthetic milk, which will be in a quantity double or even triple what their stomach can handle. Remember I said a newborn’s stomach holds five milliliters of milk or whatever we put in it. When the baby, at the first meal, receives fifteen milliliters of formula or synthetic milk, you realize that stomach expands, yes, three times more than it should, and the baby will be full, will regurgitate, will not want to eat, will not be hungry, because they just received three times the amount they needed.

Because a normal amount is five milliliters, not fifteen. So you receive the baby with fifteen milliliters of formula in their stomach for the first time, and your reaction is to put them to the breast. The baby has two options: either they will be totally uninterested in the breast, because their stomach is full. And, you know, if you’re not hungry and you just ate, nothing will tempt you. That’s exactly what the baby does. No matter how much you try to put the breast in their mouth, they will push it out with their tongue. The second option is that they actually get hungry and are brought to you exactly at that time, after six or seven hours from their first feeding with formula, and they feel hunger. Okay, this is the good scenario, where the baby takes the breast in their mouth and will do exactly the movement they learned when they were first fed with a nipple, that is, with a bottle. And they will see that no matter how much they press with their gums and squeeze the breast, nothing comes out.

After a few attempts to press as with a nipple, the baby will get frustrated and refuse the breast. A clever nurse, who is just hanging around, instead of minding her own business, if she doesn’t know better, will say: “Don’t you see, dear, you have no milk?” And that’s where the madness starts. You actually have milk. Your baby just doesn’t know how to feed at the breast, because they got confused when they received their first meal with a nipple and will believe that from now on all meals work like with a nipple. So we have to unlearn the baby from the nipple to teach them the breast. And here, if the mother doesn’t have an IBCLC lactation consultant, if she doesn’t have someone or doesn’t know and doesn’t have this information, she will believe the baby refuses the breast because she has no milk. And that’s why ninety percent of women who say “I didn’t have milk” actually went through this, where the baby wasn’t interested in the breast because the nipple was their reference, and secondly, because the baby was full and had no reason to be hungry, because their stomach was three times bigger than it should have been fed.

So this is what we’re talking about when the baby—why would they refuse the breast—does this. Why do they suddenly refuse the breast? Let’s say you’ve been breastfeeding for a few months, but suddenly your baby doesn’t want to eat anymore, even though they have no other alternatives, you haven’t given a bottle, they’re still a baby. There are also moments when the baby suddenly refuses. Why? Because they feel the mother. The mother is probably too emotionally overwhelmed, and the baby feels this because it is transmitted through her milk. You might say you don’t believe me. Test it and you’ll see that when you’re not well, your baby mirrors you and isn’t well either. When they refuse the breast, you are either too disconnected or too preoccupied with something else. That’s why I want to ask you not to plan to do anything else in the first three or four months after birth except care for your baby and your own well-being, because nothing else matters.

Life goes on without you. And everyone manages just fine without you. And you’ll see that’s how it is. And your number one priority, so you can survive and get through this exhausting period, is to connect with your baby and be there one hundred percent for them and for no one else. That’s the secret, right? So, they may suddenly refuse the breast because you are no longer in the state your baby would want to receive the energy you transmit through your milk. Because, being a liquid, it is imprinted with your state. So yes, again we see how everything starts from the top. And yes, unfortunately, we have to take responsibility for these states, and there’s no point in blaming the messenger—me—if I tell you these things. Because whether you believe it now or not, they happen, so it helps you more to understand why, than to get upset and say it’s nonsense. Because these things, at some point, you’ll have to understand, because your child mirrors them perfectly.

So, if they refuse the breast, it doesn’t mean your milk isn’t good, and some medical staff are experts at this. Many nurses say the baby refuses the milk because it’s not good, not fatty enough, not… I don’t know, it’s watery. That’s nonsense. Breast milk never turns to water. Never. The only time breast milk replaces water, because water quenches thirst, is the foremilk. When you attach the baby to the breast—not talking about colostrum, but every day, every time they drink—the first milk that comes out is what quenches thirst. Then, the milk acts as water. But that doesn’t mean it becomes watery and has nothing in it. Now you’ll see that if you pump, the milk will separate, and there will be a more watery part on top and a fattier part below. Again, that doesn’t mean your milk is water, just because it separated. But breast milk never turns to water. Not at six months, not after six months, not at one year, not at a year and a half, not at two years, not at three years.

If a child nurses until six years old, if that’s what they and their mother want, the milk they drink will be exactly perfect for the child’s age. And you’ll soon understand, when I explain that each feeding comes with requirements—requirements the baby signals. I’ll probably explain soon, in another course or this one, why the baby orders exactly the milk they need at the moment they nurse. It’s fantastic, isn’t it? There’s nothing like this in the synthetic milk industry, because that’s always the same. It has no antibodies, no oligosaccharides. If it contains some artificial substitutes for oligosaccharides—I’ve seen they’ve tried to do that. And by the way, formula or synthetic milk is mostly made from cow’s milk. And now I know most of our parents grew up in the countryside with cow’s milk and turned out fine. But I just want to ask you one thing. Mammals—all animals that give birth and nurse their young—make a specific milk for their own young.

Special, they don’t drink each other’s milk, a baby from another mother. It happens in nature for a kitten to be adopted by a puppy or other things, but in principle, each mother’s milk is specific to the species. And now I want to ask you something. Do you know that a calf grows and becomes an adult in three or four months? Good. In how many months, in how many years does a child become—not mature, but grows, develops? When do they become an adult? At how many years after birth? After 18, in America after 21. So we can’t talk about the same trajectory, the same evolution, not even the same numbers, figures, years in which we live here and develop and grow and reach maturity. So milk—whether it’s cow’s, donkey’s, which is now in fashion, or goat’s, which is Yang or whatever—is used for their own species. Goat’s milk is for kids. Cow’s milk is for calves. Monkey’s milk is for monkeys, donkey’s milk is for donkeys. So there’s no point in feeding our child with the milk of another species. I hope that’s very clear, plus many children develop intolerance to such substances that are not for their species. Plus, it’s not just cow’s milk, there are many other ingredients found in synthetic milk. So the breast is the most important. If the baby refuses the breast, it doesn’t mean your milk isn’t good, but there are the scenarios I’ve listed so far. So breast milk never turns to water, not now, not in three months, not in six years, not in two years, never. So it’s not that as your child grows, your milk gets weaker and worse. In comparison, the two substances, the two liquids, cannot be compared. Breast milk will never be replaced by synthetic milk. And now, if the baby refuses the breast, it may be because they have another immediate need.

There are many babies who, when they cry, mothers only know to plug their mouths, to feed them. But the baby doesn’t only cry for that reason. The baby cries for many other immediate needs. Here’s an immediate need: reconnection. Another need: patience, calm, peace. The baby needs a connected mother, not a mother who connects to the internet and is on her phone and is totally disconnected from the baby, even if they are skin to skin. The emotional connection is missing, and the baby needs to feel safe, not just near a mother who is a thousand miles away in her thoughts. The baby needs to feel connected. It’s like in a couple, when you’re with your partner, hugging, but you’re on your phone and he’s on his, and you’re supposedly hugging. It’s the same thing, and it’s felt. So we need patience to understand why the baby behaves a certain way, to calm down, to reconnect.

And yes, we need perseverance to continue and not give up because we don’t understand or can’t guess what the baby actually wants. Most of the time, the baby just wants to reconnect with the mother, to have a mother who is not just physically present but emotionally present, to be held, to transfer warmth from mother to child. And yes, maybe they want to be changed. And yes, maybe they have a restrictive frenulum. Here you can see how the tongue and that string under the tongue is very, very tight, and the baby cannot suck if the tip of the tongue is so tied. So, for example, if there is a restrictive frenulum, a minor surgical intervention is needed, which can even be done by our pediatricians in Romania, where that frenulum is cut a bit so the tongue is freed and can latch onto the breast and suck. To be able to breastfeed, the baby needs to have a more mobile tongue, so the tip of the tongue must be free.

So, please remember to look in your baby’s mouth when you see they really can’t latch onto the breast. And yes, if you have a chosen lactation consultant—and yes, I recommend you have one and get informed before you give birth, to see who you could call. Talk to them, go to their courses. Even though you get all this information from me, it’s very important to have someone to call when, let’s say, you come home from the hospital or need someone to quickly check if you’re attaching the baby correctly, if there’s a restrictive frenulum, why the baby might be crying, what’s wrong. Because sometimes your entire breastfeeding journey depends on half an hour when someone comes and tells you, “Ah, look, here it’s not right, do this and you’ll see everything will be perfect.” So sometimes it’s really worth having a consultant who gives you exactly the information to help you avoid months of suffering with sore nipples and other issues.

And now, how does the baby latch correctly to the breast? And this means I will now show you how to avoid nipple wounds and not suffer for months with those wounds that form very quickly and heal very slowly. I speak from experience, because with my first baby I had only read one book, which was very important, probably the most important book about breastfeeding by Ina May Gaskin, but I didn’t realize how important attachment is. And I made a mistake, because the first latch I did in the first hour after birth was a faulty latch that caused wounds, and for three months, while I breastfed almost non-stop, I struggled terribly with nipple wounds. After the baby ate, I would literally sweat from the pain in my feet. That’s how much nipples can hurt! You can’t imagine the pain. And yet, out of the stubbornness I possess, I didn’t give up, and I’m glad and proud today that I didn’t give up and didn’t give even one bottle. I didn’t have formula, but not even other milk. Almond milk or coconut milk, which is indeed an alternative to the nonsense and chemicals found in formula. Now, I’m not saying you should do the same. The idea is that I want you to be informed and to know that if you know how to attach the baby correctly to the breast, you won’t need consultants or creams or ointments to heal your wounds.

Breastfeeding does not hurt and does not necessarily require all sorts of oils or creams to endure. If breastfeeding is done correctly, the baby will not cause nipple wounds. As you see in this picture, the baby’s eyes are wide open and they are connected with the mother, and their lips are flanged. So they are not biting their lips, because if they bite their lips, they cannot suck. The nose is free, because if, for example, part of the breast covers the nose, they won’t be able to breathe and will automatically let go of the breast and not feed. The hands are on the breast. Usually, they massage. I told you the baby does this instinctively to increase lactation. So the areola must go as deep as possible into the baby’s mouth, where the soft palate begins. So, what is the areola? Here you can’t see the areola—the areola is the brown part that must go as much as possible into the baby’s mouth, along with the nipple. And for example, if you have a huge areola—some women have a very large areola—the baby’s mouth is only so big, maybe. So what do we do to get as much of the areola into the baby’s mouth? We compress it like a sandwich, yes? We flatten the areola to get as much of the brown part as possible into the baby’s mouth.

And now, the deeper the latch, the deeper into the baby’s mouth, the more the mother’s nipple—you see it here. You don’t need to have a nipple of a certain length. The nipple, even if it’s short and is about one and a half centimeters when erect, let’s say, it will reach, because we don’t just count the nipple, but also the whole areola, and the baby, when they start to suck, creates a vacuum and pulls in the nipple, stretching it a lot, and the nipple reaches the area where there is no more bone in the palate, here in the mouth, and reaches the soft part. Now, think a bit: the baby’s mouth is tiny, especially at birth. Your nipple will easily reach the soft palate, where, when the baby sucks, they push the tongue up and press the nipple against the palate, the roof of the mouth. The deeper the nipple is in the baby’s mouth, the deeper this upward compression will happen, where there is no more palatine bone and there is the soft part. And that does not cause wounds. So, I repeat, this is number one. Write it down! The areola, that is, the brown part of the breast with the nipple, must go as deep as possible into the baby’s mouth, as deep as possible, where the soft palate begins. So, nothing simpler than that. The more superficial the latch, the more the woman will get wounds in a few minutes. So the baby doesn’t need to suck for seven days to cause wounds, five minutes of a shallow latch is enough and you’ll have wounds so painful you won’t even be able to touch your nipple with a finger. Believe me, it’s not worth it. So the areola can be compressed, just as you see here and here.

To get as much as possible into the baby’s mouth. I looked for pictures to show you that, no matter how small the baby is, the areola must go as much as possible into the mouth so you don’t suffer and struggle with wounds, as I didn’t know and got wounds. And for three months, it was a nightmare, because it could have been totally different if I had had the information I’m giving you now. And now let’s see what kinds of nipples we have. Supposedly normal nipples, flat nipples, puffy nipples, short nipples, long nipples, inverted nipples, or, let’s say, those that go inward. Then we have degrees. If it only goes in a little, it’s grade one, more is grade two, and when it goes in completely when excited, we have umbilicated nipples, that’s what they’re called. They are umbilicated on the other side. But please don’t worry, because even an umbilicated nipple, that is, one that goes in instead of out when excited, the baby will manage because sucking will eventually pull it out.

The important thing is to breastfeed with your nipple and not with a silicone shield or protector, because many things happen when the baby’s saliva reaches (three-second pause) directly on the mother’s nipple and not on silicone. So another thing, please don’t believe anyone who tells you that you need to “train” your nipples for breastfeeding. That’s another gimmick from those who want to sell their creams. To supposedly help you breastfeed. Creams that contain antibiotics and other junk you wouldn’t even put on your tongue, let alone your skin, right? And think that the baby sucks that junk afterwards, no matter how much is absorbed. So the nipple does not need to be trained for breastfeeding, neither during pregnancy nor after. The nipple just needs to be protected by a correct latch, and nothing more is needed. I need to prepare my breasts, the nipples, I don’t need to prepare them. No, you don’t need to prepare your breasts. You can breastfeed with any kind of shape or without any shape.

And here I’ve prepared shapes for you—zero shapes. That is, they are flat, believe me, you can breastfeed calmly, because those lobes exist for you too. That’s the thing, when you have milk, your breasts will grow by at least one or two sizes, so it’s time for pictures. You can have this nipple, bigger breasts, smaller, rounder, more lateral, more centered, more saggy, to one side. It really doesn’t matter, any kind of breast, you can breastfeed. And yes, there are women with silicone implants. And yes, those women—it depends on the surgery they had. Theoretically, it shouldn’t affect breastfeeding, but you should probably consult with the surgeon who did your augmentation to see if it interferes with the milk lobes. Usually not, but to be sure if you’re in such a case, talk to your surgeon.

And now, back to how the baby latches correctly to the breast. I really ask you to take a picture of this PowerPoint so you know exactly what to do. Take a picture of this image to understand. The areola is the brown part. You can see here that the areola is very large and doesn’t fit entirely in the baby’s mouth, but the areola is the brown part that goes as deep as possible into the baby’s mouth. The nose must be free, otherwise the baby will let go of the breast and stop sucking. The lips must be flanged, and the first twenty seconds are for adjustment. That is, from the moment the baby grabs the breast, a vacuum is created, and the woman feels for twenty seconds that, yes, the baby has latched. If after these twenty seconds of adjustment, the word “I’ll just endure it” comes to mind, at that moment you must reattach the baby to the breast, because the latch is not correct. If you continue and say, “I’ll just endure another ten minutes so they can eat like this. Even if I feel pain, I’ll endure,” the word “endure” without a hashtag is harmful, it causes wounds.

So, please don’t stay with this idea that you’ll just endure another ten minutes. Because when the thought appears in your mind after you’ve attached the baby for twenty seconds, “I’ll just endure it,” that’s when a wound forms. Because nipples are very, very sensitive. You can’t dry your nipples with a towel as you would your back, because you’d go crazy. You can’t, right? It’s not normal to do that. It’s a very sensitive area. So, when the thought appears in your mind after you’ve attached the baby for twenty seconds, “I’ll just endure it,” please detach the baby and reposition and reattach them. How do you remove the baby from the breast? How do you release the breast? Because when the baby latches, a vacuum is created. If, for example, you just pull the baby, a vacuum will be created and your breast will be like a hickey, right? That’s not what we want. Instead, simply insert your little finger into the baby’s mouth to release, to allow air in...

Air, to release the vacuum. After that, the baby automatically lets go of the breast and you can better reattach the baby, this time with as much of the areola covered as possible, nose free, lips flanged. And you check again. After twenty seconds, the thought pops into your head, "I have to endure" or "I can endure." If it happens again, what do you do? You detach the baby with your finger in their mouth and reattach the baby a fifth time, an eighth time, a tenth time. It doesn't matter how many times, it's better to do it ten times than to injure yourself. Usually, by the second or third time, the baby latches correctly. So what I want to tell you is that breastfeeding does not hurt. If it hurt, no one would do it. And breastfeeding is natural. When the baby latches correctly and does not compress or have a shallow latch that causes wounds. So wounds are not hard to get. Wounds happen very easily, after just a few minutes of incorrect breastfeeding. So please, it's not worth ruining months of recovery and struggling with pumping and other things because you can't put the baby to the breast anymore, as it becomes unbearably painful. Please, keep this in mind. We attach until we get a correct latch and breastfeeding does not hurt. Breastfeeding does not hurt, and you will see that when you do it correctly, you feel no pain. Absolutely none. Good. I hope this is very clear now. Here are two more pictures. This is a correct latch. The nipple remains perfect, does not develop lacerations, does not get wounds, it's a correct latch, right? And this is a shallow latch. If the baby feeds like this, after an hour you are a wreck. You can use seven creams, you'll want to rip your nipple off, that's how much it hurts. This is a nipple that, after two or three minutes of sucking like this, will be wounded, will bleed, will crust, and it will be torture. And breastfeeding is nonstop in the first two months, so you don't have time to go a week without breastfeeding, because at that point we're not talking about breastfeeding anymore, but about supplementation. So not like this, but like that. It's very simple, correct latch versus shallow latch, it really is shallow. And now, those who advertise all sorts of creams, please keep in mind what I'm telling you now: nipple wounds or cracks, as they're called, will not be treated with lanolin, because that ointment is sheep fat. And maybe, even if you're not vegan, you won't want your baby to ingest that sheep fat. They're not at the age to digest such things and it's not appropriate. So lanolin, even if it's very good for wounds, in the case of breastfeeding, I do not recommend lanolin because it will end up in the baby's mouth (coughs), and the baby does not need to suck sheep fat, because that's not normal. And of course, nipple cracks or wounds are not treated with the chemicals in that heavily promoted cream. I won't name it, though it's very clear, but that's what all gynecologists prescribe even during pregnancy, because the marketing is so strong for these products that they teach you to use that cream on your nipples during pregnancy, for example, when you never even thought of it. So it's absurd to think that your nipple is being prepared for something by applying a cream full of nonsense. Read the leaflet and think if you would put that stuff on your lips. By the way, it ends up on the baby's lips. Not just on the lips, because it's not lipstick, it ends up in the intestines, the baby ingests that junk. What I do recommend, and it's not an ad, it's the only one I recommend and it's worldwide. There may be other creams or ointments that are good, but this one you can find anywhere, in any country you live in. I treated my own nipple wounds from my first breastfeeding experience, which went completely wrong, with this plant-based ointment. And yes, it helped me a lot to heal wounds you can't even imagine. When I removed the crusts, how much it hurt and how much it bled, it was horrible. So wounds or cracks are treated with this ointment. Usually, you apply it after breastfeeding. Wait until the next feeding, you don't need to wash it off, because whatever the baby does after that, it doesn't change the nipple's smell or taste. And those plants inside do not harm the baby, even if exclusively breastfed. What heals the wounds is a correct latch. Yes, it will be a bit of a struggle if you already have wounds, but a correct latch actually fixes the problem. What else do we do? After breastfeeding, express a drop of milk and let it spread on the nipple. That is, anoint the nipple with milk. Because milk is very good and heals very well. So put a little breast milk on the nipple, and be patient and keep your breasts as exposed to air as possible. Here in the picture you can see what an irritated breast looks like, but if you haven't been through it, you can't imagine how it feels to have such a nipple. You can't even touch it with your fingertip. That's how much it hurts, and that redness is terrible. I don't even want to think about it anymore, because it gives me shivers. Because it's horrible to have such wounds. So it's not the Mother Love balm, it's the only cream I recommend, because it really is very, very effective, good, and healthy. 

And now, what does milk engorgement mean? What does breast congestion mean? Or, as it's now called, mastitis? Mastitis is the medical term. Mastitis happens when, for example, the lobes that fill with milk, due to the baby's position while breastfeeding, the lobes that are lower or to one side are not emptied and inflammation occurs. This inflammation, as a first sign, causes localized pain exactly where those lobes are full of milk. The breast hardens, feels heavy, full, those lobes are full and the area gets warm. Well, before this happens, if you feel pain in a certain area of the breast, put the baby to the breast in a position where you feel it empties from there. Usually, we do it from the side or underneath. When we do it from the side, put the baby in a side position under your arm and then the baby will suck exactly those lobes. Now, if the baby doesn't want to suck anymore, ask someone, or your partner, because in the end, you should know that breast milk is very tasty. I tasted it and it tasted like whatever I was eating most at the time. I ate a lot of pineapple and pomelo. That was back then, many years ago, thirteen years ago, in winter, and I just loved raw pineapple and pomelo. So my milk tasted like pineapple pudding, it was extraordinarily good and sweet. So yes, you can ask your partner to empty that part of the breast, because if not, an abscess can form. And ladies, this abscess means hospital, means incision, means antibiotics. I don't know how many days it means stopping breastfeeding, it means suffering and surgery. So we don't need surgery. It's not something to treat with cabbage. Inflammation really shouldn't be left to escalate when you can so simply either ask your partner to empty those lobes, or, if not, okay, without a partner, just massage from that area toward the nipple and you'll see that the milk can be expressed, but it's best done manually because you decompress the area. I know it will hurt, because the area is already painful, but I want to ask you not to get to the point where you can't even touch yourself or when you already have a fever.

In the exam, Navy Circle, this is a standout test for when your mother tries to breastfeed after you are born in order to be a nursing mother. When she gets tired, she goes straight to sleep because she has no choice and her child cannot breastfeed anymore. When she does not feel understood by her child, when the mother feels that she is being used as a nanny, it means that she is good at giving milk only because she can do nothing else. So, when thoughts like this come to you, you are approaching the red zone, so it's better to talk about it than to feel otherwise. Or when the mother feels overwhelmed by how dependent the child is on her, and then there is somehow the danger that she will develop mastitis. And there is another thing, when she does not feel understood by her partner, when she receives too little emotional nourishment from her partner. What does emotional nourishment mean? It means understanding, validation, it means the partner sees her, this is the message, because it is an extraordinary effort. It is said that this parenting, which is done exclusively by the mother at least until the age of two, two and a half, is the hardest job in the world. It is equivalent to two and a half jobs. That is, it's non-stop. It's like working non-stop for someone who doesn't pay you. Of course, no one will pay us, but the satisfaction of having a healthy, happy child who smiles is worth more than anything material or monetary in this world. So, my dear, be very careful with the emotions that arise, and emotions will arise, because we are in a super hyper-vulnerable state. So I ask you to be very attentive to your emotions, precisely so you don't end up in such situations.

And now I want to ask you to prepare for two months in pajamas, because that's how it will be, the first two or three months of babyhood are like two months of honeymoon with the baby. And in these honeymoon months with the baby, you need to sleep when the baby sleeps. Food should be served to you in bed. You won't have time to cook, so you'll ask your partner or someone to cook for you and bring you whatever your heart desires. And please, leave the housework to someone else, because you need, especially as a first-time mother, to get used to this role and not feel overwhelmed, because you won't have time to do laundry, clean, sweep, vacuum, or dust. These are things you can delegate, even to your mother, mother-in-law, or anyone who wants to come help you with the baby. The problem is, you don't need help with the baby. You need help with the housework and all the roles you had until now. So you need your husband's support, you need someone to cook for you, if he knows how, wonderful, you need him to validate you and be by your side and spend time together with your baby. But yes, for the rest, you need to find people, relatives, or people you can pay to do those things. A mother does not need help with the baby, but with everything else she can no longer do due to lack of time and energy.

And now, how long does breastfeeding last? Well, I just said. In the first weeks of life, it will be non-stop, breastfeeding non-stop, because the baby will keep waking up, falling asleep, waking up, it's a cycle of waking, sleeping, waking. If you want to detach the baby, they cry. That means they're not full. So it will be a kind of situation where you don't know when you slept, when you woke up, when you drank, when you did anything. The idea is that the baby cannot be trained and cannot be put on a schedule except with lifelong trauma. That's basically what baby training and those sleep coaching programs do to the baby. The key word for the mother is this: Organize yourself so you have nothing else to do but be with your baby. Believe me, it goes by so quickly, you won't realize when the time has flown. And I say this, for example, from my point of view, I now have two big kids, ten and twelve years old. When I say ten years, twelve years, I can't believe it... I can barely remember how they were as babies. Babyhood doesn't last long. These moments when the mother is super exhausted, I know, are very hard, and I went through them twice and had no help. I didn't organize myself the way I teach you to, and still, I kind of miss those moments, because I didn't know to savor them and imprint in my mind the baby smell and that fantastic need and that smile when they looked at you like you were the sun, right? All these things pass so quickly, believe me, they last only a few months. It's worth spending your time, because that's why you wanted a child, not to check something off a list, but to spend time with your baby. Which, unfortunately, most of us didn't have, for example, with our own parents. That's why I recommend this time with your baby, these honeymoon months with your baby, so you can also heal your own childhood traumas. So, the secret to a happy baby who doesn't cry is the mother's constant presence. Stay with your baby non-stop for the first four to six weeks, I say two months. Sleep with them, no separate beds, no separate rooms, no devices, no baby monitors, no nonsense, no cribs. You don't need them. It's money thrown out the window. They will become furniture to pile up clothes and things you don't need. After two months, no activities where you're not in their visual field, because the baby has a big fear that you'll disappear or leave. Just like what happened in the hospital if they were taken to the neonatal unit. So the baby's biggest fear, especially if it happened at birth, is that the mother will disappear. And so, to avoid this terror, that the mother suddenly disappeared, please, be present in your baby's life. Stay inseparable for the first two months, and after that, please, stay in your child's visual field. The visual field is this much. They can't see to the side, here, or behind. So any stroller, any option where the baby is lying on their back looking at the ceiling, that's not why they came to spend six months in a crib with bars looking at the ceiling, the baby needs visual contact with the mother. Doing something in the kitchen? Take them with you. They're awake? Put them somewhere so they can see you, right? Because they need not to be left alone. That's their biggest fear. We, as adults, live with this big fear too, only we manage, because we're a bit older, to handle it somehow.

And now, let's see how you know your baby is hungry. You should know that very few women know that before the baby starts crying, as you see here, there are several stages where they show they're hungry. Here, let's say they're still sleeping. That's the first image. In the second image, the baby starts to open their mouth and smack their lips. They make a (smacking sound) like little fish. Here, in the third image, they already start smacking and turning their head both ways, like a beacon, searching for the breast. So they'll do this. (smacking sound) You hear it, right? Because you sleep with them and then you know clearly that the baby is ready for food. Here you see they open their mouth wide again. Here they start to frown. They keep searching, squirming, start putting their hands in their mouth and sucking on them and will go: "Yes?" (squirming sound) Yes? This is not play, this is not, oh, how cute my baby is! This is a sign of hunger. Then they keep putting both hands in their mouth and if after all these signals, no one realizes the baby is hungry, they will start to cry. So you have many stages to realize your baby has a need and is hungry. Usually, if you sleep with your baby, from the first smacking and head turn, you know they need the breast and you will feed them. But if the baby sleeps separately, again, the disadvantages are that you don't hear them. Maybe the device only turns on at certain sounds. The baby doesn't want to stay alone in a tower or a room. And what if you paint it with all sorts of silly drawings? As if cartoons matter to your baby? The baby wants to stay with their parents, with mom and dad. So the father shouldn't be exiled from the bed either, but the baby comes to meet both of you and to be introduced to the world they came into. That's your role as parents, not to exile the baby to their crib, their room, and their kingdom, because they didn't come to be alone. We are not solitary beings, don't forget that. The baby is not condemned to sleep alone, especially in the first years, when they need a human being next to them the most. Who could that be? Mom. How do you know they're full? Look, when you fall asleep with them and when they don't cry or let go of the breast. Because now I'll tell you that you will be their living pacifier. You will have unwashed hair for two or three weeks or even a month. Sometimes you won't even get to brush your teeth in the morning, let alone at night, but you will be head over heels in love with your baby. That's how your house will look. Nothing will be as it was before, but you have to get used to this idea. If you want a peaceful life, because if not, you'll go crazy. How do you know the baby is full? When you see them fall asleep with relaxed hands, that's the moment when the baby opens their fist and lies with their hands up. This is the moment for you, dear mother, to steal some good minutes of sleep next to a full and content baby, at least for the next thirty minutes. So don't waste time, and sleep when you see your baby has fallen asleep full and content. Because those are some good minutes of sleep and you will definitely want to steal them, because you'll want to sleep standing up, just to sleep. Thank you for watching and see you at the next breastfeeding course.
