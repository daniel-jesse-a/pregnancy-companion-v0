(theme music) My dear, congratulations on completing this course about breathing during labor and delivery. I want to tell you that by going through these lessons and practicing them starting today—as you’ve seen, the first one will take you two minutes a day. Believe me, these will be the best investments you will ever make in your child’s birth. The second one will take you a maximum of five minutes a day, which you’ll spend anyway—you know where—and you’ll be able to vocalize the “ha,” right? Yes, these breathing techniques are extremely important because they will help your body do its job exactly as it should.

Now, what else do you need to do? It’s important for any human being to understand the process, because once our mind understands, first of all, fear disappears, and secondly, the risk of blockages disappears. Ninety-five percent of blockages during birth are emotional. So, please pay special attention to physiology—not just what your body knows how to do, but what your body can do when you don’t block it, when you don’t force it to tense up, or when you don’t do exactly the things you shouldn’t do.

One of the most important things is to aim for a beautiful pregnancy, lived with joy and enthusiasm, with as little stress and as few states of anxiety or fear as possible. As I mentioned before, fear comes ninety-nine percent from not knowing. Please, believe me, this will be the best investment you will make, not just in your child’s birth, but in your journey together in this life. Because the way you experience your birth is how your child will perceive their arrival in this world. If you go through birth with terror and fear because you don’t know how your body knows to give birth, you might do things that your body interprets as a blockage, leading to all sorts of interventions that are painful and many of which are considered obstetric violence.

You could skip these stages by informing yourself. Please, watch the basic course where I explain fundamental things, where I explain conditioning, and the relationships between what the body manifests and what triggers these manifestations. If you know what’s happening to you during pregnancy, you’ll need far fewer, let’s say, check-ups that induce fear and bad feelings, because you’ll have much more confidence in the process your body already knows how to do.

So, you need to know the physiological process of birth, but above all, you need to understand yourself. Why do you go through very emotional moments during pregnancy? I explain all these things. I explain them once in the basic course, and you can access it at a discount directly from this platform if you purchase now. There will also be smaller courses on specific topics. For example, I recommend you learn how your uterus works, how your cervix works, what the cervix is, why it needs to dilate, what causes the cervix to tighten and refuse to dilate. I will explain all these connections, and they will make perfect sense. They will show you that emotions have immediate physical counterparts.

So, I will explain how the cervix works. I will explain how a contraction works. I will explain what dilation means. In these smaller courses, yes? You can choose to follow what the uterus does, how it manages contractions, what a contraction means, how the uterus moves, how the muscles move, how the baby is propelled out, how big a woman’s pelvis is, whether the baby can fit through the pelvis. Of course, the baby can fit. But what does the cervix do, what does the pelvis do to help the baby pass more easily? Did you know your body prepares itself for birth? I’m telling you: it does. And if you know these things, you’ll be able to experience your birth from a place of safety and confidence, not fear and tension. And that tension brings blockages.

So, it’s very important, besides all the knowledge you’ll gain by following my courses, to also build your birth plan. Maybe you’ve found it, maybe you’ve seen it. It’s about four or five pages. The issue isn’t just seeing what’s written in the birth plan. The issue is: do you know all the procedures in the hospital? Do you know what to expect, what the standard procedures are in a hospital, whether public or private—it’s exactly the same. Do you know your rights? Did you know you can request that your baby not be taken away from you? Did you know you can request delayed cord clamping? Did you know that stem cells shouldn’t go to a stem cell bank, but should go into your child’s body? Did you know your child is the most valuable and cheapest bank—in other words, free—where they store their own stem cells needed for their entire life, not a company we pay to take our child’s stem cells? Did you know your child doesn’t receive about 30 milliliters of blood if we cut the umbilical cord immediately? You’ll find all these things in the Birth Plan course, which, let’s say, we complete together. Because for almost four hours, I will explain to you, point by point, what to ask for, what your rights are, what the standard procedures are, what you can check “no” for, what you should check “yes” for, what would be good for you, what would be good for your child, which interventions you can say “no, thank you, I don’t want,” and which interventions are truly necessary.

So, there are many aspects, besides these two breathing techniques, that need to be addressed. Because yes, I want you to be prepared for birth, and that’s why you’ll also have the discount I mentioned earlier, directly from this course platform. And yes, especially since you’ve already purchased one or two or more courses from me, you’ll get this discount, and please, take advantage of it, because believe me, your child deserves it.

And by the way, all these courses and all this information you receive from me and will continue to receive by accessing these courses will help you save money in many other areas where you would have thrown money away without blinking, not believing you might end up spending two or three times what birth will cost you. Because yes, our system exploits pregnant women, and during pregnancy, a huge amount of money is wasted, because it’s money spent on fear—on fear, because you’re told a story that your child is in danger, that you don’t know how to raise them, that you don’t know how to develop them in your womb, and that your womb doesn’t know how to do this. Which is not really the case. But yes, this subject of manipulation and fear is a very lucrative one.

So yes, my dear, you will spend some money on these courses, but it will be infinitely less than what you could spend during pregnancy by being deceived and threatened by the system. Because yes, the system sells on the idea of fear, of actually instilling fear. Unfortunately, that’s how it is. So, please, watch the videos again, look through my course platform, see which course interests you. Please, look at contractions, look a bit at the cervix, at the woman’s body, the woman’s pelvis. These are very important topics that will definitely help you.

That’s it, I’ve gone on too long, but I feel these things are very important and it’s important for you to know them. It is important for you to know them. Thank you, and I wish for your birth to be just as you want it and as your baby would want it too.
