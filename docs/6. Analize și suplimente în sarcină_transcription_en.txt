Good morning, my dear! I am glad to find you here at this recorded course about pregnancy and birth. My name is Dita Depner and today I want to present to you the lesson about tests and supplements during pregnancy. In this chapter, I will address pregnancy from the perspective of modern medicine and especially from a holistic point of view. What does holistic mean? We do not think of the body as a machine, but we also look at what kind of emotions we have during pregnancy. Especially since the importance of emotions in pregnancy is very, very vast, because they influence your well-being. You will see how these emotions affect your states and implicitly your blood tests. We will talk about the Nocebo effect on the development of the baby in the womb, and I will tell you a bit about the most important blood tests, without going into detail. For details, I have another course where I discuss blood tests in detail. I will talk about the Beta hCG test. I will talk about hemoglobin and normal values during pregnancy. We will also discuss a bit about how to interpret blood tests. I will also talk about folic acid, that supplement which is already prescribed to you from the first moments you find out you are pregnant. And we will talk a bit about the supplements recommended during pregnancy.

Blood tests during pregnancy become a burden for any future mother, because from the moment she finds out she is pregnant, suddenly, she is treated as a sick person. Dozens of blood tests follow every month, every trimester. It has become a trend for women to get checked, even though they are healthy, feel good, and have no reason to suddenly consider themselves sick. The modern medical approach, even if it is modern, is quite primitive regarding pregnancy, as the pregnant woman is considered sick, and the body of a future mother is seen as a machine that must be obsessively serviced and overanalyzed. I do not understand one thing. If you analyze the blood at the beginning of pregnancy, why do you think that month after month or trimester after trimester, these tests should worsen in any way? As long as you have a balanced life, there is no reason to worry that your health is deteriorating. The irony is that there are many examples of pregnant women who had conditions before pregnancy, and these conditions went into remission during pregnancy. So, the body functions at maximum health when the mother is pregnant. So, why not stop considering ourselves sick? Why not stop seeing ourselves as machines, as if our servicing stage has come the moment we find out we are pregnant? How did the body function until now, and why wouldn’t it function now that you found out you are pregnant? And one more thing: if it were that simple to think that we take a car to the service to have some things changed, we just analyze the diagnoses, yes, we analyze the body, we analyze the blood, we put it into some parameters and give our opinion on what should be done. But no one changes anything, does anything specific, because yes, it is not in our power to service ourselves. So, it depends a lot on what we ingest, what we eat, our lifestyle, to maintain our health. It is exactly the same rule as when we are not pregnant and, theoretically, should take care of our body that carries us through this existence.

What are the causes of poor test results during pregnancy? You should know that the number one cause is the woman’s emotional state. Because her emotional state determines and influences the test results, depending on how she lives and experiences her pregnancy, that’s exactly how her tests will look. A woman who suffers—and we will talk about the sufferings of women during pregnancy, which are not classic at all, but are simply manifestations of the subconscious. These women, indeed, having a poor state every day, with suffering, will produce poor test results, because the blood we take at the moment of collection reflects exactly our state at that second when the blood was collected. So, do you have a happy pregnancy? Your tests will turn out wonderfully. We will discuss shortly how to interpret these tests and how simple it would be to rely on logical and natural things.

So, you have two options: do you want to live your pregnancy in fear, in panic, and create diagnoses, conditions, problems, or can you choose to enjoy, to inform yourself, to find out as much as possible, so you can have a wonderful, joyful pregnancy. All hidden emotions, especially those unexpressed, because, you see, a woman needs to talk. Everything we keep secret or hidden or unexpressed will manifest through unpleasant symptoms. This is at the conscious level. That is why it is very important during pregnancy for a woman to have support, because, having support, feeling understood, listened to, heard, and seen, those hidden emotions can be externalized and will no longer manifest through unpleasant symptoms. Why are we somehow predisposed during pregnancy to bring to the surface hidden, previously unseen or surprising emotions? Pregnancy is a very important moment in a woman’s life. At that time, at the subconscious level, all her memories from her own childhood are stirred up. Why do you think all these problems come to the surface then? So that you can heal them before birth. Why? Because all hidden, unexpressed problems that manifest during pregnancy will appear as complications at birth. This is not a concept I invented, but simply epigenetics talks about these things and it is known that all unresolved traumas manifest as complications at birth.

I am absolutely convinced that you want a beautiful and fulfilling birth, and there is no reason not to resolve these problems, these hidden and unexpressed emotions, especially since your body shows them to you during pregnancy. There is no point in not resolving them.

The tests done on a future mother are not as invasive on the physical body as those done on the fetus in the womb. However, even if it does not hurt to go have your blood drawn... (three-second pause) those moments of waiting until the results come out and until you are told whether you are okay or not will produce a nocebo effect. What is a nocebo effect? Placebo is when I take an aspirin and know that if I take that pill, without knowing what it is, I am told it will cure my stomach ache. Which usually, an aspirin should have nothing to do with the stomach. But because I believe it, the stomach pain disappears. Read Joe Dispenza. He has a book, also an audiobook, called "You Are the Placebo" and there you will find many examples of how our mind works in this placebo state.

Nocebo is exactly the opposite of placebo. When someone repeatedly tells us we have a problem, we will start to believe we have that problem and we create it. So, a woman who waits a week or three days—because three days can feel like a month—waits for some tests that must confirm whether she is okay or not, whether her body is okay or not, this makes her enter and maintain that state of anxiety, of unnecessary worry, which creates emotional conflicts and deteriorates physical health. How does this happen? Well, I put myself in a state of stress. Stress deteriorates physical health. And stress does not mean I have a demanding job, but stress can mean a conflictual state that consumes a lot of my emotions. Because these conflictual states are the biggest consumers of emotions and energy, so I sabotage my body by putting myself in a nocebo state, that is, expecting the worst, creating a bad state, creating stress in the body and influencing my health.

So you might say: Yes, I will only do blood tests for myself that do not influence the child. Surprise, it does not influence the child directly because you are not testing the child, but you... you are the womb that contains this baby, and your baby feels all your emotions. So, if you are sad, your child will feel the sadness and will bathe in his amniotic fluid in a sea of sadness. So, why not enjoy pregnancy more and not worry so much, because, usually, most tests do not really reflect the reality of your emotional state or your health.

Let’s see, from my point of view, which blood tests are important, because if you open the internet, you will be overwhelmed, you will be literally robbed by how much money you can spend on blood tests, which in the end are not all important. The first test you can do from your blood is called the beta HCG blood test. This test analyzes, in fact, human chorionic gonadotropin. This gonadotropin is produced starting from the tenth day after conception. Usually, a woman, after taking a pregnancy test, rushes directly to the doctor. But she does not know that the doctor has nothing to tell her yet, because the pregnancy is tiny. The baby is not even the size of a grain of rice. So, there is not much to see except with a lot of effort and a lot of nocebo effect, of course, because any ultrasound test will have to be an intravaginal ultrasound, which does quite a lot of harm to the fetus, the embryo, in full development. That is why, instead of rushing to the doctor, if you still need, let’s say, proof that you are pregnant, I recommend you do this blood test, which should double or triple every forty-eight or seventy-two hours. That is, every two days I go and have my blood drawn and see if this gonadotropin increases. Here I recommend, (swallowing sound) here I recommend you maybe take a picture so you have these values, so you can follow them. But I would rather recommend you trust the creation process of your embryo, of the soul that chose you to be its mother, because it knows very well what it has to do and if it is to stay, because it is a viable pregnancy, it will certainly stay.

Let’s talk about hemoglobin or iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy, especially since this test is very much feared by women. I want to explain some very logical and simple things. Because when we become pregnant, we no longer have menstruation, that is, we no longer lose blood monthly. The blood volume in a pregnant woman increases considerably with each new month of pregnancy, due to the absence of the cycle. So, instead of losing that blood for nine months, we accumulate it in the system. As a result, the concentration of hemoglobin, which are these red platelets you see on the screen, they get diluted. So, if the concentration drops, that is, it gets diluted like a syrup, when you put too much water in a glass where you put a layer of syrup, at some point it becomes a sort of watery liquid with a bit of syrup. Exactly the same, the blood volume increases in the woman’s body because she is pregnant, and the hemoglobin concentration drops. So, do not compare the hemoglobin value of a pregnant woman with the hemoglobin value of a normal person, of a woman who is not pregnant. Normal values are around 12.5. So, anything below 12.5, modern medicine, at least in Romania, considers a deficiency. Well. That is not true. As you advance in pregnancy, the normal values are between 8.5 and 9.5. Please note these values so you do not start supplementing for nothing, and this supplementation, which is done without much knowledge, yes? Creates problems for the baby, because values that do not drop below 10.5... It has been found that there is a risk of premature birth or low birth weight of the child. Why? Because when I have a higher iron intake, there is a deficient absorption of zinc. What does zinc have to do with it? Zinc is related to the growth of the fetus in your womb. So, if there is a deficient absorption of zinc, the fetus, the baby in the womb, will not grow properly.

So, if you have tests towards the end of pregnancy, because that is when it should be checked, yes? Between 8.5 and 9.5 is perfect. If you already had tests during pregnancy at 12.5–10, please do not take anything because you do not have iron-deficiency anemia. There is no need to supplement, because, first of all, supplementation with inorganic iron leads to constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, and especially a deficient absorption of zinc, which is a growth factor for babies. I hope you have noted this, so you do not panic when a doctor in Romania suggests you supplement because you do not have values at 12.5. These things are known abroad. Michel Odann, the doctor, Dr. Michel Odann, has written in his books about this frequent mistake made by gynecologists, because they consider this drop in hemoglobin concentration a problem, but without taking into account that the blood volume increases, because we no longer have a cycle. So, more relaxation, because not everything is as it seems or as you are told. That is why iron tests, at least in Romania, are very often misinterpreted.

When a woman has conflicts related to her blood, that is, she doubts that her blood is good, waiting for the tests, yes? She will create emotional conflicts that will affect her organ that produces hemoglobins, and these hemoglobins contain ferritin. So, we affect the spleen, because it is the organ that produces hemoglobins. And if we affect the spleen, it will no longer produce those hemoglobins so much analyzed and awaited. And now, how can you affect your spleen? Well, if you already have a conflict and you are afraid to go for tests, you are afraid of needles or have a phobia, you are afraid that your tests will come out bad. You have also had nosebleeds. Then you were told that all pregnant women in Romania must do thrombophilia tests. Then you were told that maybe or you had bleeding in pregnancy even at the beginning and you got scared. And, of course, doubt. Because why do we analyze? Because we doubt our own blood. So, all these fears create conflicts, and these conflicts effectively affect the proper functioning of your body.

This gentleman is a doctor in England. There was an article published initially in October 2014, and Dr. Patrick Quanton made a sort of, let’s say, public statement, for which, of course, he was later incriminated, because doctors who have the courage to talk about taboo subjects, which actually reduce the income of Big Pharma, are, of course, marginalized. This doctor studied at... What do we actually analyze when we collect blood? And he rightly asks, who established those normal values? Concluding that some people do not fit into those normal values and are thus considered sick. You should know that we do not come with a user manual, as a machine does, so we do not know what our normal values are. We consider health as the absence of disease. And then, the irony is that before this obsession with doing tests monthly, weekly, annually was invented, people were considered healthy by how they felt. From the moment these tests started, some probably British researchers, I’m joking, gathered some values and considered those values normal. Very interesting! What is the criterion by which a person is healthy and what is the criterion by which a person can be sick or very sick? In my life, so far I have met many people who told me they had perfect tests, but felt terrible. Or sick people whose tests came out perfect. So, it is very interesting how we determine health and how we determine what the value is when you are not healthy. Because there is no standard. So these are conventions established by some people. And now I want to go a bit more in depth.

When we analyze blood, we analyze blood from veins, not from arteries. Everyone knows this. It is not something new, because we analyze venous blood. We all know that the venous circuit transports residual blood. That is, look, do you see my mouse on the image? Here, in this arm we have the venous circuit, and here, in the same arm, in red, we have the arterial circuit. Good. Our body functions with the help of trillions of cells in the body that do their job and keep us alive. These cells take from the oxygenated arterial blood all the nutrients they need and consume them. What is extra? These cells expel into the venous circuit. So we do not have stocks. We cannot, as they say, put aside for a rainy day, but simply the cells take exactly what they need, and the surplus is effectively expelled from the cell into the venous circuit. So what do we find in venous blood? The surplus of residues of the human body, of each cell. And we are a collection of little factories, because each cell is like a factory. It receives nutrients, oxygen, and water and expels the surplus and residues. So, in fact, when we analyze venous blood, we analyze what the cells have expelled and the residues that are no longer needed, because they are residues and are sent into the venous circuit. So, very interesting, right? The residues are expelled from the trillions of cells because they are residues. They are not needed. And when we test the blood to draw hasty conclusions about the functioning of organs or the entire system, let’s see. How interesting it is that our organs are not in the arm from which we draw blood, but are elsewhere in the body. We have a chance to find in that arm the cells that have expelled the residues and surplus from that area. Yes? Again, a very interesting way of thinking, let’s say, adopted by modern medicine. So we analyze the residues and surplus that were not needed. What does surplus mean? It means it took everything it needed, and this was extra. So, when we find out about our blood, we might find out about deficiencies that actually attest to excellent or good productivity of the cells. So, when something, that is, the surplus, is small, the logical conclusion is that the cell took exactly what was needed from the arterial blood, let’s say iron, yes? It took enough iron and expelled a surplus into the venous circuit. This surplus, even if it is a small value, does not attest that the cells do not already have enough iron inside, but this is the surplus. So productivity is perfect, but we interpret it incorrectly. And then, if the surplus is large, that is, the cell expels a large amount of iron because it has enough, we will think it is overproduction, but in fact it is not so. Because, even if, let’s say, this attests to a slower activity, it does not mean it is deficient.

So, what I want you to understand is that the cells of your body produce everything you need, especially when you need it. It is not about a distribution system of nutrients, but I want you to think of your body as a complex waste management system, because the cells expel waste into our venous circuit. So, what looks like a deficiency or a deficit—I think that is a better word—actually shows and speaks about excellent productivity. That is, everything works well, but we interpret the tests incorrectly. And so, a woman with a healthy lifestyle, as they say, for a lifetime, yes? Because now is not when a healthy lifestyle begins. It becomes, at the moment of finding out about pregnancy, a sick person who must be analyzed and overanalyzed to be able to fit again into the template of a functional woman. Yes, so the body works very well during pregnancy, just as it worked very well before. How is it possible, I keep asking myself, that until finding out about pregnancy, the body knew so well how to survive without so many tests? And now, from the moment of pregnancy, everything is turned upside down. It is not true. It is just what we believe.

So, as long as you have a healthy lifestyle, where your water and food intake is as unprocessed and pure as possible, you pay attention to your restful sleep at the right hours. What does the right hours mean? Between, between, uh, ten in the evening and two in the morning. It is said that then the body rests, the body and mind rest best and then the greatest amount of melatonin is produced, which gives us that deep rest. If you have a balanced emotional life, without too many shocks and conflicts—of course, they exist, but you can manage them—then believe me, as a woman you are perfectly built to carry and grow your baby in the womb. So, where does all this fear come from? Well, with fear you are manipulated the easiest. The fear that you do not have the right blood. The fear that you should have something. The fear that something is happening. No. The pregnant woman was built to carry her child in the womb. Now, if you really know you do not have a healthy lifestyle and you eat chaotically and do not eat what you should, here it would be good to consult a, uh, nutritionist who can recommend a varied and diversified diet.

Otherwise, I think it is common sense to know how you live and how you manage in life. And now, what can you do concretely? So that your baby, as they say, grows the little fingernail on the left hand. This is a joke, because we cannot do anything specific to make the little fingernail on the left hand grow, but simply have to accept that the creation process happens thanks to this soul that knows how to start that creation process, which is its intrinsic genetic program to self-create. We, that is, our body, the woman’s body, is just the host or channel through which this soul receives a body and we welcome it into this world. So, that worry that, oh, if I did not eat that carrot, the finger did not grow. It is not true. Eat healthy, take care of yourself emotionally, be balanced, and you will see that the creation process happens anyway. The more relaxed you are, the happier you are, the more enthusiastic about yourself and what is happening in your body in a miraculous way, the more beautifully, harmoniously, and peacefully the child will develop, because there will be no stress. Whose stress is it? The mother’s, because the child feels it.

And now I want to tell you a bit about folic acid in pregnancy, because in Romania it is wrongly recommended during pregnancy and especially since there is a trend here with a lot of thrombophilia in pregnancy, it is even forbidden in genetic mutations like MTHFR in thrombophilia. So, folic acid is first taken before you become pregnant. So, it is not a supplement to be recommended during pregnancy. It is, first of all, a synthetic supplement, and the liver does not metabolize synthetic or artificial medicines, because it has nothing to do with vitamin B9. Folic acid is an artificial variant of vitamin B9 and in Romania, unfortunately, it is even overdosed four times. This overdosing comes with risks, because there is an increased risk of over 45% for breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, and 21% risk of bronchial asthma in the child. So, what are we talking about? Do you really want to expose yourself to these risks? For what? Thinking that you cannot get folic acid from folates, because that is what folates mean, and you have there, on the screen, an image of what folates are.

Well. You have not eaten salad, you have not eaten broccoli, you have not eaten avocado, you have not eaten, I don’t know, red beet or cauliflower or asparagus or... So these are things we eat anyway. And so, there is no need to supplement with something synthetic, which anyway is not metabolized and anyway gives many negative effects. Folates, to be clear, not folic acid, are recommended before conception and at most in the first trimester of pregnancy. That is, if we want to supplement. But that does not mean that in the second and third trimester I no longer eat avocado or Brussels sprouts, or broccoli, or asparagus, or oranges or papaya. So it is absurd to think that. So eat what you want and stop worrying so much, why should you supplement now? Because if I go online, I go crazy when I see what is happening there and what people say.

So! The baby in the womb grows imprinted with your emotional state. Please, I want you to be relaxed. Because your baby will not be affected by your nutritional deficiencies. Of course, you take care not to have nutritional deficiencies. If you have deficiencies, the baby will use your reserves. Well, if you starve yourself, if you eat irresponsibly and do not eat what you should, yes, the child will eat from your reserves. But if you have a balanced life, then everything will be perfect. And think, what influences the baby most is your emotional state. Please, be well. That’s all. You do not have to do anything else.

And now all those synthetic supplements that have been recommended to you, because, ironically, you go to a gynecologist, yes? That gynecologist has not studied nutrition, yes? He will give you some classic synthetic supplements, yes, which all doctors recommend. And they will be synthetic medicines that the liver does not metabolize as it would with vitamins and nutrients from food, which are natural, which is why these remain in the body. And what do they do? Do they just sit there? Synthetic things do not, they make you sick because they overload your lymph. Anyway, it is a broader subject, but believe me, the more synthetic supplements you take, the more work your liver has to do to eliminate and metabolize those toxins, because ninety percent or, let’s not say ninety, eighty percent end up where? In the toilet. Because only ten, maximum twenty percent of these synthetic medicines are assimilable. Because what does our body do? Our body has an innate intelligence to recognize any vitamin, mineral, and anything good from food and to reject everything synthetic, overloading the lymphatic system, overloading the liver, and causing you other problems. So, do you want to take supplements? Do you feel you are not eating properly? I recommend you look for supplements that are not synthetic, that are extracted from food, from leaves, from vegetables, from superfoods. They exist. Anyway, the others you take for nothing. They may be cheap, but they are useless and you intoxicate yourself. So choose consciously, choose wisely. Choose now that you are informed and change your diet. Change this supplementation if it is—and do not do it obsessively, because it does not help you, and the emotional state is what matters. Thank you for watching and I hope to see you in the next video about pregnancy and birth.
