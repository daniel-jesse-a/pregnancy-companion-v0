Hello, my dear! I am glad to see you again at this module about breastfeeding. In this module, I will explain how your body produces personalized milk according to your baby’s needs—the secrets of individualized human milk. Why? Because every mother produces milk for the baby who nurses at her breast. I will explain this to you during the course. What imprints itself on breast milk? When does lactation begin? How long should we breastfeed? When should we start the wonderful process of introducing solid foods? Because here, again, there are many controversies, especially those fueled by the industry that wants to sell us formula and jarred foods. Is there such a thing as intolerance to breast milk? Breastfeeding during pregnancy, especially when very few doctors in Romania know what to recommend to a woman. Breastfeeding twins or triplets—how is it done, is it possible, is the milk sufficient? Fertility during breastfeeding, as this is also a very controversial topic. How to decrease milk supply for weaning, and breastfeeding and placenta expulsion after birth is a very important module, especially since you might not learn all this information in the free hospital courses, because breastfeeding is not encouraged there, first and foremost. 

It would be good to take notes, because breastfeeding is the most important transfer of health from mother to baby. Let’s begin. Mother’s milk is also called the elixir of life, because it cannot be replaced or reproduced. And another thing—let’s say that technology and science, even in our century, have not managed to reproduce breast milk, no matter how hard they tried. You should know that breast milk is alive and personalizes its composition according to the child’s current needs. For example, if the baby nurses in the morning, he will receive one type of milk. If he nurses three hours later, he will receive another type. If it’s summer, the baby gets a different kind of milk. If it’s winter, another kind. If the baby nurses for a longer time, he gets another kind of milk. If there are twins, each twin receives their own personalized milk. It is incredible how complex this breastfeeding process is. You should know that breast milk is the ideal nutrition, at least for the first two years of life. This is also stated by the wonderful World Health Organization, which is not always so wonderful, but at least recommends breastfeeding for at least two years. 

Why? Because until two years old, the child needs to complete the development of their immune system. That is why breastfeeding is actually the completion of the immune system, because when the child is born, they do not have those antibodies that come only from mother’s milk. That is why breast milk has never been able to be replaced, because formula, first of all, does not contain human milk and, secondly, does not contain antibodies. Because, yes, that’s what it’s about. Let’s see what the first encounter with perfection is. Here you see a newborn baby, whose head is still deformed, which is normal and physiological, and in a day or two the head will become normal again and not pointed, as you see here in this picture. The first thing a baby does in the first half hour after birth is latch onto the breast. Usually, the baby climbs to the breast on their own, because it is an instinct they simply have, without a map, without GPS. The baby seeks the breast because there are receptors on the mother’s areola that secrete a sebum with a smell and taste similar to the amniotic fluid in which your baby stayed for nine months and tasted. 

Why? Because on their tongue there are taste buds, and during pregnancy, the baby swallows and tastes the mother’s amniotic fluid. I have a separate course about amniotic fluid where you can learn many important things, such as how much amniotic fluid should be there in the womb, what qualities it has, what the baby does with it, what the baby doesn’t do with it, and so on. How the baby swallows and does not inhale amniotic fluid for nine months and how the baby actually survives underwater for nine months. But that’s another course. Returning to lactation, how does the mother know what milk to prepare for me? Because this is usually the big question for everyone who learns for the first time that when a mother breastfeeds, she gives her baby a personalized milk. 

So, at no moment, when breastfeeding, is the milk the same. There are pores on the areola—I’ll show you the areola now. Here we’ll talk, Mima, about silicone nipples, which should not be used. There are pores that secrete and receive and come into contact with the baby’s saliva, and this baby’s saliva actually tells the mother exactly what milk is needed. That’s why, for example, if we breastfeed two children even at the same time, one will receive from one breast the milk they need, and the other could receive totally different milk for a two- or three-year-old child. So, it’s incredible how intelligent our body is and how it knows to produce exactly the milk the child needs. 

And now, if its composition changes, you realize that the nonsense you may have heard, maybe not, that after a year of breastfeeding, someone says: “Oh dear, don’t you see your milk is just water?” is not true. It’s not water, because if it were water, it wouldn’t be called milk. But milk changes its consistency according to the baby’s needs, whether the baby is one day old, six months, one year, three years, four years, until we stop breastfeeding. Milk is never just water. 

Milk has exactly the nutrients, vitamins, and minerals the child needs. It will never be just plain water. So, don’t listen to what people say and understand that these things are proven, yes? Even scientifically. Even if science hasn’t managed to reproduce milk, there are many studies showing that milk is alive and changes its consistency and, let’s say, its recipe, yes? At every feeding. 

Now, silicone nipples cause a serious disruption in breastfeeding precisely because they prevent the personalization of breast milk for the baby. When we put these nipples over our own because our nipples hurt or because we didn’t know how to latch the baby correctly, this exchange between the baby’s saliva and personalized milk will no longer happen, and the mother will not produce personalized milk, just milk from the baby’s sucking mechanism. 

So, avoid silicone nipples. You shouldn’t need them, because that means you didn’t know how to latch the baby correctly. That’s why you got wounds. Breastfeeding doesn’t hurt and is easier if you know exactly what to do. So, please, watch the episode where I explain how to latch the baby to the breast, because it is the most important thing you need to do after birth, since you will be breastfeeding for two years, with breaks of at most one, two, or three hours in between. So, believe me, it will be the most intense activity you will have in the next two years after birth. It’s really not worth using silicone to protect your nipples just because you didn’t know how to latch the baby well. It’s simpler than you think and you don’t need to worry that you won’t know how. It’s very simple, you just need to go through the course on latching the baby to the breast. 

And now, to show you that you can actually see it with the naked eye, mother’s milk differs in color from one pumping to another, as these milk samples were pumped, and mother’s milk, through this variety of colors, can be said to be alive, dynamic, and full of antibodies. 

What else imprints itself, besides being alive, dynamic, and full of antibodies? Milk is a liquid that a woman modifies due to or because of her state while breastfeeding. That’s why babies, when they eat, you’ll see, are very attentive to the mother being there and very present. Usually, when the baby nurses, he connects intensely, eye to eye, with the mother and doesn’t let her look at her phone, TV, or talk. Usually, he puts his hand on her mouth, yes, or detaches from the breast. That’s what happened to me every time I tried to talk to someone while breastfeeding—my child would detach from the breast, look at me, and wait for me to calm down, then reconnect. So, besides giving milk, we transfer our emotions to the baby—love, agitation, all our states. So, it’s very important what state you are in when breastfeeding. Just like the elders used to say: “Dear mother, never eat when you’re upset!” It’s exactly the same. Please do this and keep it in mind when you breastfeed your baby. Only breastfeed when you are in a good state—not upset, not crying, not angry—because all the nervousness, all the frustration is transmitted through the milk to the baby. 

Why do I explain this in the first, basic course, when I talk about the secrets of birth? Because the baby absorbs all the mother’s emotions like a sponge, already from the womb. So, when we transfer another liquid into the baby, namely breast milk, the same thing happens. So, milk is imprinted with the mother’s emotions. So, pay attention to how you breastfeed your child, what state you are in, how you feel. Because besides being imprinted, yes, breast milk is the healthiest, the best, the most nourishing, the richest in nutrients—nutrients that no formula can contain. And yes, it is alive. That is the difference between formula and living mother’s milk. Here you see the color difference from a lighter yellow to a more intense yellow, orange, even green shades. It’s not necessarily about what the woman eats, but clearly a mix of what she eats, what she feels, and her emotional state. 

Let’s see from what moment in pregnancy lactation is formed. Although it may seem like a strange question, you should know that you already have milk from week fourteen, let’s say sixteen, of pregnancy. All pregnant women have milk production starting from week fourteen to sixteen. So, if you’ve heard women say, “I didn’t have milk,” know that, yes, I understand that they went through the experience of believing they didn’t have milk. But milk is formed already from then, during pregnancy. So any pregnant woman can breastfeed, she just needs to know how to breastfeed, how to stimulate lactation. That’s the secret. So how do we stimulate lactation? Because it exists. It exists from the moment you become pregnant. You’ll see in another course about lactation, I also talk about women who adopt a child and can stimulate their lactation so that it starts. 

And now. Until what age do we breastfeed? My dear, my advice is to breastfeed exclusively, meaning only milk. Don’t give tea, don’t give water, don’t give food, because as long as the child doesn’t ask for or isn’t crazy about something else, he will eat only breast milk. I breastfed exclusively, and my children didn’t even want to hear about solid foods, and both of mine ate almost exclusively breast milk until one year and two months. 

So you understand that I’m not some weirdo, I was also surprised (laughs) by this experience with them, because I really tried, at least with the first, to offer diversification by the book, which didn’t work because the child only wanted the breast, wasn’t interested in anything else. And look, they both grew up. With the second, I didn’t stress anymore, but you should know that in the past, not our grandmothers, because by then everything had already changed and formula had appeared and was like a kind of mother—“It’s much better, it’s improved.” Not at all. It was just advertising and bad information, because even now women don’t know this information unless they hear it from a place where the truth is told, not marketing stories. 

So, before, our great-grandmothers breastfed exclusively until one year, one year and two months. That’s about when the child started to walk, because that’s the age when children start to walk and then, indeed, they were super ready to eat something else. So, after that, that’s what exclusive breastfeeding means—giving only milk to the child. That doesn’t mean that if he’s curious and reaches out after seven or eight months, you don’t give him, because he might taste. Because the child is in that oral phase where everything goes in the mouth. That’s how he learns about things, that’s how he’ll taste his first vegetables, fruits, and whatever you decide to give him. 

Breastfeeding continues after introducing solids, until at least two years old. Because, as I said, breastfeeding is lifelong immunity for the child. So what you do now, that effort—yes, I know, maybe for two years you won’t sleep three hours straight. But believe me, the female body is incredibly adaptable and you’ll see you’ll function. I didn’t sleep for four and a half years because I breastfed two children, one after the other, and for one year and two months I breastfed them in tandem. I’m not saying it was easy, but believe me, it was the best investment in their health, which is rock solid. My children have never taken antibiotics, have never been to the hospital except when my daughter broke her arm. But that wasn’t an immunity issue. Otherwise, they don’t know antibiotics, antipyretics, they haven’t taken medicines. Indeed, we use homeopathy, essential oils, natural things, and believe me, it’s possible. But yes, you need to know a bit about what you’re doing and be confident that what you’re doing is right. So, until what age do we breastfeed? 

At least until two years old. After that, you can decide if you want to continue, if it makes sense or not. Yes, but I breastfed my first child for four and a half years, and then he weaned very nicely. 

At what age do the first teeth come in? Because this is the biggest question for women. Oh no, if he gets teeth, what will he do? Will he bite me? My dears, a child, in principle, does not bite the breast that feeds him. Only if he is very frustrated and picks up on the mother’s frustration, or if he wants to get the mother’s attention. Or sometimes it happens just in play. But the child does not bite the breast. So, even if they have teeth. And at four and a half years old, he really had a lot of teeth in his mouth. Usually, the first teeth come in from three or four months onward. It’s not a must that they come in then. Some come in at six months, but usually the bottom ones. Then the top ones, as you can see in this picture, at some point the baby starts to have not just gums, but even with the gums he can latch. The idea is, as I said, to be very attentive and connected with the baby and not be angry when breastfeeding. 

Speaking of anger and emotions, the child can refuse the breast if the mother is angry and transmits angry milk. And then yes, there are many children who wean or refuse the breast because they no longer want to receive it and distance themselves from this aspect. 

So teeth are not a danger to breastfeeding. And yes, you can breastfeed calmly because your child, believe me, needs your milk. And when you breastfeed, it’s not just about feeding. There’s much more there. It’s about love, connection, many things. 

And now, when should you start introducing solids? Here, I allowed myself to write that it’s about self-led weaning, because the child will show you very clearly when he is really interested in food. Not just to chew on it and taste it, but to actually eat it. What I ask is that you don’t join Romanian weaning groups, because it’s terrible here. Women start solids at too young an age, for example, at four months, which is crazy. Think about it, the child’s digestive system is ready to digest something other than breast milk only around nine or ten months. Until then, everything introduced comes out undigested and unchewed. Of course, there can be exceptions. Of course, in every case, we’re not robots, we’re not all the same. But I’m telling you to follow your child, because he is the best compass. Follow him and you’ll see when he’s interested in solids. There are some things, or, let’s say, signs you can look for to know if your child is interested in food—when he can sit up on his own, which doesn’t happen at six months, but around seven, eight, nine months, depending, when he can grab with his hands and not put it in his eye, forehead, or nose, but in his mouth. So coordination needs to be in order. And yes, not only that. Don’t think that when you eat in front of your child, which I recommend, the child, you might just watch him and see that he actually imitates you. He starts to chew because he watches you and simply imitates you, because children always copy-paste. 

And when you see your child chewing, it’s not that he craves, I don’t know, sausage or other nonsense, because the child doesn’t know anything else, he just imitates you and that shouldn’t mislead you into thinking he wants it too. But if he reaches out, then yes, you decide what you want to give him as the first food to introduce into his body. 

I would recommend you also follow some websites. For example, follow cristelageorgescu.ro, where you’ll find out what’s healthy and what’s not. There are many women who speak from experience, not TV nutritionists who say all sorts of nonsense, especially in Romania, where there is no real nutrition school. So, please, look for or join international baby-led weaning or finger-food groups, because you’ll find much more advice about introducing solids there. 

Now let’s see until when milk is digestible. This is about the myth that you should drink a glass of milk at night to sleep better. That’s nonsense. You should know that an adult digests milk, usually any kind of milk, whether it’s from an animal or their own species, only until about two years old. Here you’ll see a bit about lactose intolerance, because many people today are lactose intolerant. But not knowing this or not understanding why they have stomach problems or why they never liked milk is another discussion. The idea is this: I want you to think that formula, besides being collected from another species, is hydrolyzed, improved, transformed, and has many other things. I have a special lesson, “What is formula?” Please watch that lesson, also in the breastfeeding course, and you’ll see that what you get, besides being milk from another species, which each species should drink its own milk. 

So yes, for us, because we got used to cow’s milk, then donkey’s milk, then who knows what other kind of milk, but you should know that these liquids are for their own species. For example, a calf is an adult in three months, while a child at three months is still a baby. A child doesn’t mature until about sixteen years old, and the difference in development is totally different between a calf that drinks cow’s milk and a child who drinks the same cow’s milk, which is theoretically perfect for calves, not for children, because it has the properties for growing a calf, not a child. That’s why be careful with animal milk, because yes, I think everyone doesn’t digest this milk from another species and even our own only until a certain age. That’s why we shouldn’t use it later as a staple food. “Oh my, you have to drink milk!” 

Good, let’s talk about breastfeeding during pregnancy, because this is also a very controversial topic. Why? Because in Romania, most doctors say: “Oh my, if you’re pregnant, you must not breastfeed anymore, because you’ll give birth prematurely, you’ll take nutrients from the baby in the womb.” I’ve heard all the versions. You should know that if it were really dangerous for us to breastfeed during pregnancy or over a pregnancy, we probably wouldn’t have lactation. But our body continues to produce milk, even when you become pregnant again. So, breastfeeding during pregnancy is possible and even recommended. Indeed, the period between fifteen and twenty-five weeks of pregnancy, when a woman is pregnant again, can be a bit more challenging for the pregnant mother, because it becomes a bit painful. But know that with patience and perseverance, that period passes. I breastfed during pregnancy and, indeed, during that period between fifteen and twenty-five weeks of pregnancy, it hurt more because the nipples became much more sensitive and because the milk supply decreased a bit and the child was more irritable at the breast. 

But in the end, with patience, it passed. And I am glad and proud that I didn’t stop breastfeeding my first child and continued until four and a half years old. So, look for a lactation consultant: IBCLC, International Board of Lactation Consultants. That’s what IBCLC means, and you’ll see that—they also recommend, of course, breastfeeding during pregnancy, if you want that and if the child still needs it, because there are many children who are close in age and when you get pregnant, maybe the other is one year, one year and a bit, and still needs your breast milk. 

Now let’s see about breastfeeding twins and triplets, because many mothers think: “Oh my, I didn’t bring the children here and I can’t have enough milk, haha. I don’t have enough milk for one. What if I had two or three or two children? One older, one younger…” My dear, the milk is enough because it is formed according to the needs of each child, even at the same time. So, if you have a child and another you’re still breastfeeding, know that your body will make milk for both. Why? Milk is formed in the brain. That’s where the hormones oxytocin and prolactin start, go down into the body, and plasma is transformed into milk. So, as long as you’re alive (laughs), there’s plasma, there’s milk. But if you don’t stimulate the breast—how do you stimulate the breast? By putting the child to the breast. Then yes, the milk will decrease. So, a mother with twins can perfectly breastfeed twins, because the body will produce exactly as much as each twin needs to eat. And then it will know there are two children nursing and we produce exactly what’s needed. 

Triplets. You can breastfeed triplets. I’m not saying it’s easy, because you have to put three children to the breast and you only have two breasts, right? But yes, they can be fed in turns. That’s why I say, if you have one, you should breeze through breastfeeding, right? Because that’s not a problem, to breastfeed one child. But you need the right information and to start breastfeeding on the right foot, not with information from your mother or grandmother, who maybe didn’t breastfeed or only breastfed for a month or lost their milk, or you know, the stories we’ve heard all our lives. 

Now, about fertility, after how long does menstruation return? My dear, for some women who breastfeed exclusively, meaning only breastfeed and don’t supplement, meaning really breastfeed a lot, that plasma won’t turn into menstruation and the woman, for example, may not have a period for a year, a year and a bit, depending on how she breastfeeds. For me, after exclusive breastfeeding, my period came only after a year and two or three months, when the child really started to taste and eat and, let’s say, didn’t nurse at every meal at the breast, but ate and then took dessert at the breast. So that’s how it was. Then lactation decreased and my period returned. 

How soon does a mother who is still breastfeeding become fertile? Here’s the biggest issue: while breastfeeding, a woman is already fertile. So don’t rely on not having your period, because it can be tricky. So be careful with intimate relations, use protection, because you might not even know when you become pregnant again, breastfeeding and without a period. (happy background noise) 

And now, after a year or two, I hope that now, after you know all these things from me, you will breastfeed for two years, I can also tell you a few words about how to decrease milk supply when you want to wean. My dear, abrupt methods don’t work. Don’t send the child to the countryside, to the grandparents, or to the city, to the grandparents, since now grandparents are in the city, to wean the child. Breastfeeding is reduced gradually, weaning is done gently. You explain to the child beforehand. Gradually, you stop breastfeeding during the day until you also reduce night feedings. That’s how it’s done. Nothing works abruptly and we don’t wean with medication. Because, honestly, think about it, you’ve breastfed for two or three years. The body needs to reduce milk production, because otherwise, after two years of constantly producing milk, it will continue to do so and you’ll get hyperlactation. You might get all sorts of complications, mastitis, so you don’t need medication to wean. And never wean abruptly. 

It’s a trauma for your body and a psychological, emotional trauma for the child. So everything is done with patience, with discussions, nicely, gently, because it’s possible, yes? So no abrupt things. 

Now let’s see what happens immediately after birth when we put the baby to the breast. Breastfeeding stimulates contractions. Why? Because on the areola we have receptors that signal the body that someone is stimulating the nipples, and since we know nipples are actually an erogenous zone, this produces oxytocin, and oxytocin produces contractions that will eventually expel the placenta. So, my dear, please watch the course about contractions and the placenta, because now you’ll understand a bit better, by taking the breastfeeding course, how everything is connected. So, in the first thirty minutes after birth, you put the baby to the breast and this causes contractions and the natural elimination of the placenta, at your own pace, at the placenta’s pace—not pulled, not with hemorrhage, not with brutality, not with the doctor’s hand inside to remove the placenta, not with curettage. Naturally, because it’s possible, yes? 

Naturally, everything is natural. So you don’t need an oxytocin drip, you don’t need anything. You just need to wait, put the baby to the breast, let him nurse, because while your baby is in your arms and nursing, the placenta will detach precisely due to these contractions. And then the detachment and birth of the placenta will happen naturally, without drips and without pulling, because that’s what these helpers are for. I attended a birth where, because the doctor was in a hurry and pulled on the cord, she caused the woman a hemorrhage and almost lost her. So we don’t play with such things. 

During this time, while you feed your baby and the placenta does its job and detaches from the uterus and is born, you can enjoy breastfeeding and a good meal. Because after birth you will definitely be hungry and I recommend you have good catering at hand, because you can order anything nowadays, since hospital food is for the sick, and a woman who has given birth is not sick, so you can eat well if you order your own food from somewhere. 

And yes, everything will flow, because it is natural for a woman to know how to birth her placenta just as she knows how to birth her baby. Thank you and I look forward to seeing you at the next breastfeeding course.
