May your heart be well, my dear! I am Dita Depner and today we are meeting for a course about breastfeeding. Specifically, how lactation is formed, because it is very important for you to understand how it develops. And not only that. Where does the milk collect? After that, you will be interested because you need to integrate the information about how lactation starts and is maintained. I will tell you about the physiology of lactation, about how the baby sucks, how much the baby sucks, meaning how big the stomach is from birth until the first few months. We will talk about breast pumps, because it is fashionable now to have devices at home, which are not necessarily needed. We will talk about where lactation is formed, about the hormones that favor lactation, and about the brain and the connection between the brain and breast milk, because everything happens in the mind. Yes, very interesting, isn’t it? When you know this, especially if you have watched my other videos until now, you will see that I say the same thing about birth. Because birth, too—half of birth—what half? Ninety-five percent of birth happens here, with the subconscious, with memories, with all sorts of imprints. So, it is a complex subject, and all these topics related to emotions have a great weight in the conscious, subconscious, unconscious, and so on. But let’s get back to how lactation is formed, because that is what I want to talk about in this course.

And now I have shown you—I am actually showing you an image. Where—to show you where the milk collects. The milk collects exactly in these lobes. You see them here, pinkish. And the ducts or these, let’s say, threads that start from the lobes lead to the nipple, and the nipple does not have just a single channel through which the milk spurts, but has many ducts or threads that will actually express the milk when the baby starts to suck at the breast. What do we have here? So, these lobes are glands that produce and transform the mother’s plasma into milk. The areola is this brown part with the nipple. What you see here is—a layer of fat. Then we have a layer of muscle and, let’s say, the ribs. So, the milk collects in the lobes. From there it goes—and by the way, the lobes are not always full. This is to get rid of the idea “Oh no, I don’t have big breasts, I don’t have milk.” It doesn’t matter. Women who don’t have breasts, yes, have milk. Men who, so to speak, don’t have breasts, have milk. I said this in a previous course. If you haven’t reached it, you will, and you will better understand that the physiology of lactation applies to women, to men, to women who give birth, to women who adopt, and to women who, for example, reach menopause. They can have lactation as long as it is properly stimulated. As you see here in the image, breast milk is abundant when it is stimulated by the baby at the breast. You can also see here, in this image, how the milk actually spurts from the nipple and it is not just a single opening with a single thread, but the milk spurts through all those threads, and the baby has enough ducts from which to feed on breast milk. Breast milk has several exit paths, just as I showed you before. That is why from the nipple there is not just a single, let’s say, milk conduit, but there are several ducts that, for example, during manual expression, as you see here, you can actually see how the drops of milk form on the entire surface of the nipple. What you see here in brown is the areola. I will show you that a wider latch of the entire areola helps with a correct attachment of the baby to the breast. The more superficially the baby latches, the higher the chances of getting wounds and then struggling with breastfeeding. Know that breastfeeding does not hurt, so you only need information that will... help you know what and how to do. So, breastfeeding is not a philosophy. Unfortunately, we have so much contradictory information from this point of view that we have come to not know how to breastfeed naturally and to think that breastfeeding is a matter of luck or some privilege. It is not a privilege, it is a quality that any woman can manifest when she has support and the correct information.

Look here, a fountain! This is a stimulated breast, stimulated by whom? Stimulated by a baby who is actively sucking and who does not have a schedule at the breast, but is put to the breast whenever needed, not fed because there is a schedule. The child is not born with a sleep schedule, or a wake schedule, or a night or day schedule. When the child is hungry, they will eat, and then you must put them to the breast. So, you do not breastfeed on a schedule. Write this down because you will hear from many sources, even in the hospital, from nurses who work there, about a breastfeeding schedule. Forget about the schedule. The child, digesting breast milk in a few minutes, tens of minutes, does not need a schedule, but will eat whenever hungry. So, listen to your child’s instincts and not to manuals written a hundred years ago, which are outdated and no longer work. What you have surely heard from your mothers is the idea that breastfeeding happens every three hours. This is the biggest nonsense we have received and continue to believe, thinking the child eats every three hours, like clockwork. No. The child can eat for three hours straight, then sleep for half an hour, and then want to eat again and stay at the breast for another three hours, two hours, or half an hour. So, there is no schedule, because we do not have robot children with watches on their wrists and calendars counting days, hours, minutes.

Breastfeeding is the most natural, healthy way to raise a baby. What does breastfeeding mean? Breastfeeding means that through this areola, through the nipple, the ducts of the lobes that fill with milk will bring milk into the baby’s mouth. Exactly the picture I showed you before. Here you see again a section with lobes that transform plasma into breast milk that reaches the baby’s system. And now let’s see how the baby sucks. Because there are two types of sucking. And this is very, very important for you to understand now—the physiology of sucking and the physiology of lactation—because there is the first suck, which is a stimulation suck, and then, after a few minutes, comes the swallow suck, after the milk descends into the lobes. Exactly as I told you before, these lobes are not always full. When I didn’t know about breastfeeding and thought we function like, for example, a cow that goes to graze and comes home in the evening to be milked with a full udder. And I was... OK. So, when I breastfeed, after I eat, the milk collects and I will have full breasts that feel like they will explode. And then that means I have milk. Wrong. It’s not like with cows. And with cows, there’s another thing—they are milked only once a day. And with cows, there’s another thing—they are milked by people. People don’t milk the cow several times a day, but only in the evening, when they finish their daily feeding activities. So, it’s not like when the cow has a calf, and the calf would suck several times a day, so let’s not be left with the idea that the cow is milked only once, when the udder is full. So, this idea of a full udder is wrong, because the udder fills or the breast fills if there is already a routine, meaning if every day we have a baby who sucks, our body already knows about how much milk the child needs. If there are twins, for example, it will produce double the quantity. If we have triplets, it will make three times more milk, so our body will make exactly as much milk as the child needs.

And now, what’s the deal with lobes? The lobes are not always full. Sometimes the lobes are empty, and when the baby comes to the breast and latches, the first suck will be the stimulation suck. Simply, it’s like when you go to draw wine from a demijohn, with a little hose that reaches into the demijohn. Well, for the wine to reach your bottle or your mouth, you have to suck and stimulate, meaning you pull without swallowing, you pull air, and so you simply stimulate so the wine enters the tube and reaches you. Exactly the same happens with the baby. The baby sucks, and the first time at the breast, will suck on empty lobes. That is the stimulation suck, which can last, depending on the baby’s sucking strength, a few good minutes, three-four, maybe five-six minutes, after which the lobes fill with milk, because I will show you immediately what the circuit is, and the milk starts to flow, which triggers the second style of sucking. When the baby sucks and the mouth fills with two-three more drops of milk, they suck, suck, suck, then gather enough drops, then swallow, and you will hear a “Hm.” Just like swallowing. Yes? It is very important for you, as a mother, to be very attentive to that transition from stimulation sucking to swallowing sucking. That is, pay attention, yes, acoustically, to the sound the baby makes when the milk starts to flow and they gather it in their mouth and will suck four, five, six times, then swallow. Why? Because the colostrum that comes first, comes in drops. It is very, very valuable, very little. And so it does not flow as the milk will flow later, but simply drips, and those drops gathered in the mouth, at three, four, five, six drops, the baby will swallow.

Good. If there is this, let’s say, this circuit of sucking, stimulation, then comes the swallowing suck, when the lobes empty again, it goes back to stimulation sucking and the circuit starts over. That is, the baby sucks again for four-five minutes to stimulate lactation, then the lobes start to fill, the milk comes into the baby’s mouth, the baby sucks and swallows, and so there is a circuit. So, my next question, logically, is: when does the milk run out? Well, it never runs out. As long as there is stimulation. If I, for example, do not have patience and leave the baby at the breast for only a few minutes and they (pause of three seconds) only suck, stimulating lactation, but I do not have the patience to let the baby suck for five minutes and then switch to the next breast, the baby will do the same thing at the next breast, only stimulation sucking, without me having the patience for the milk to descend and the baby to get the milk. So, if I switch breasts too quickly, thinking nothing is coming out anyway, I actually create a conflict in my brain that I am not making milk, which is not true. You just don’t have the patience for your baby to stay at the breast and stimulate lactation, and you switch breasts too quickly, so the baby doesn’t get to suck the milk they just stimulated. So, the milk does not run out. That does not mean it hasn’t run out for women who have lost their milk or who have run out of milk. You will see, hormonally, why there are situations where a woman actually loses her milk for other reasons, not physiological reasons, but because of shock, emotional shock, psychological shock, yes, which causes a sudden change in your state. And yes, the state, again we are talking about the mind, changes your whole dynamic.

Good, let’s talk about the newborn’s stomach, to get rid of the idea that I do not have enough milk. First of all, your baby will eat very often, even every thirty minutes. Why? Because mother’s milk is digested in exactly thirty minutes. So, after eating, in half an hour, the baby, having digested the milk, can be hungry again. We have that circuit and trigger warning I already mentioned in another course, that the baby may stay even non-stop at the breast. In the first weeks of life, the idea is not to expect anything else, because you will be very disappointed when you see that the baby stays non-stop at the breast, at least in the first two months of life. The idea is that it will not be like this forever, but in the first weeks of life, the baby will indeed be glued to you. So, you will do nothing else but stay with the baby at the breast, breastfeeding. And that’s about it. That is your schedule. You will need to get food in bed there. You will need to sleep whenever the baby sleeps, so you can cope with the non-stop schedule the baby has, because they do not come with a day and night schedule, so they do not know what that is. And all those courses you may have heard of, about training the child, taming, training them to sleep at night and be awake during the day, are nonsense that generate great frustration for the child and not only for the child, but also for you, because the child will cry a lot, and the child is not even a toy that can be trained or an animal that we can train when it is older. The baby at this stage should not be taught, should not be untaught, should not be trained, only have their needs listened to, because they are primary needs.

So, as you can see, on the first day of life, the baby’s stomach is the size of a cherry, which means about five to seven milliliters of milk. That means a level teaspoon, because we are talking about breast milk, not formula which is heaped. Yes? So, a level teaspoon of breast milk at each feeding. That is why the baby will eat very often, because that breast milk is digested in thirty minutes. By the third day, the stomach has grown to the size of a walnut. One of those big, XXL walnuts, which is very good, by the way—I had a neighbor with a big walnut tree when I was little. So here we already have twenty to twenty-five, twenty-seven milliliters. Again, this is about the size the stomach can expand to at one meal. That’s why the baby eats very often, because the stomach is small and needs it, because, honestly, you are raising them with breast milk, you are not giving anything else. And that child really grows, gains weight. It’s fantastic how just a liquid from the mother’s breasts can grow a baby from zero.

In the first week of life, the baby’s stomach has grown to the size of an apricot. So, the apricot would contain around forty-five to sixty milliliters of milk at each meal. So, again, the baby will suck more and more often in the first weeks of life, and by four weeks after birth, the baby’s stomach will be the size of an egg. A fairly large chicken egg, which can hold eighty to one hundred fifty milliliters of breast milk. So, you see how lactation will increase gradually, according to the physiological needs of the newborn. Your baby is the best pump for extracting breast milk. And breast milk is stimulated and does not run out. As long as the baby sucks at the breast, it will be stimulated and produced. That is why the milk never runs out, because I have that circuit that simply continues.

And now let’s talk about this circuit that breast milk makes through stimulation, putting the baby to the breast. You see, here I have the baby who has just been received by the mother in her arms after birth, in the first thirty minutes of life. So, there is no such thing in biology, let’s say, in our biological programs, as separation from the mother, because it does not fit. No mammal leaves its baby alone for hours or days. We are the only mammals who practice this barbarity. And it has not turned out well, because children are not better off because of it. What happens when the baby is put to the breast? In the areola, that brown part of the nipple, there are receptors that, from the moment the baby is put to the breast, send information to the brain, to the hypothalamus. Which releases oxytocin from the pituitary gland. That oxytocin enters the bloodstream, and this oxytocin and prolactin, because sucking at the breast triggers maternal feelings of love—what oxytocin means—and motherhood, meaning mother-child, which releases prolactin. And these two hormones released into the entire bloodstream will produce lactation, which does what? It transforms plasma into milk, and the milk accumulates in the lobes in the breast area. It’s very simple. If I do not have the stimulus, meaning the baby at the breast, my brain, even if I have given birth, even if I love my baby and hold them in my arms, will not release this oxytocin and prolactin to form lactation. So, the baby must stimulate the breast for me to produce milk and fill those lobes. So, I put the baby to the breast. The information from the areola receptors is transmitted to the brain. The brain tells the pituitary gland to release prolactin and oxytocin, and after a few minutes, you actually feel a tingling in the breasts and the lobes fill with milk. This is the release of breast milk, through which the woman actually feels how lactation starts and those lobes fill. How do you know the lobes are full? Well, you listen to the baby. You listen and they are not just sucking, but suck, suck, suck, swallow. Then again, suck. Then, after a few sucks like this, they gather milk in their mouth and swallow. So, you will hear them swallowing. When they no longer swallow, it means you have emptied the lobes of that breast and you can switch to the other breast. Now, it depends on the baby’s strength how quickly they empty a breast. But I would be careful not to go by the clock, but by how the baby sucks. And when I hear that after four or five consecutive sucks they no longer swallow, it means there is no more milk in those lobes and I can switch to the other breast, where, due to stimulation, the milk may have already reformed and the breast may start to flow. So, I pay close attention to the baby and their sucking, and this can help me a lot to realize what stage, let’s say, lactation is in. I will talk more about lactation in another course. For now, I thank you for paying attention and taking notes.
