May your heart be well, my dear! I am Dita Depner, and today I want to talk to you about the importance of having a birth companion. And here I am not referring only to a companion such as a doula or a midwife, but I am talking about your partner or the future father, who plays an overwhelming role in actually ensuring your safety. A setting where you can feel comfortable, a sense of familiarity. There are many things that, although partners have been excluded from births, they have a very, very important role, and there are many things they have been deprived of since they no longer participate in births. So yes, today I will talk about the importance of the partner, who must and should participate in this very important event—the birth of your child.

Why is it so important? Well, it’s very simple. This child comes into the world also because of him, because the partner is equally involved in the arrival and conception of this child. And the child does not choose only the mother, but also the father. If the father is directly involved in creation, in conception, why should he be excluded during pregnancy or especially at birth? This new trend, with the man who must go out for a beer because he is no longer allowed access to maternity wards, especially in Romania—because this is a trend in Romania—is a trend that actually hides many shortcomings of our system. Shortcomings and a lot of obstetric violence, because women, at least in Romania and not only in Romania, are treated very differently when they are alone, when they are somehow just by themselves, facing a system that is incredibly corrupt or inhuman. Because that is what it is mostly about. About the inhuman treatments that a future mother experiences in a maternity ward, whether public or private, especially in our country.

Unfortunately, obstetric violence is particularly prevalent here, because there is a lack of respect, there is an incredible arrogance among those who work in the system, simply because I have never encountered so much, so much, so much lack of respect in any other medical field in this world. Where a woman receives her child and there should only be pink flowers and hearts and love and affection, the woman is met with inhuman treatment. She is humiliated, she is insulted. And all these things happen also because the man is not there. By the way, I always say, if your men knew what humiliations a woman goes through during birth, they would never leave you alone for even a second.

And speaking of this, in every country in Europe, and not only there, there is a patient’s rights law, and even in Romania, the patient’s rights law stipulates that any medical intervention entitles you to have at least one, up to two companions. So, legally, you are allowed to participate with your partner and someone else. Usually, that “someone else” could be a doula or a friend, or if it’s not the partner, it could be a friend who wants to attend the birth.

But I want to ask you to be very careful whom you choose to have by your side, because birth is not just a rite of passage. It is a moment when the intensity reaches such high levels that any person next to you could influence you, especially since you need to show a lot of strength, courage, self-control—because in those moments, you are touched in places you have never been touched before. I mean this figuratively. Emotions explode. And so, you need balanced people by your side, people who have processed their own birth and who will not project their own fears, anxieties, horror stories, or what they have heard about birth onto you.

So, please, if you have started to inform yourself about birth, invite your partner as well, because it is so important for you to embark on this journey together, not separately. Not one going one way and the other not knowing what to do with a pregnant woman. Especially since pregnant women become, well, a bit strange, yes, somehow during pregnancy, because hormonally speaking, we go through very intense states where our mood and perception change. So there are many influences that an uninformed partner, who does not know what actually happens during pregnancy, would not know how to handle.

So, please, take your partner by the hand and take the course together, because it is the most important thing you can do. I have so many examples of partners who did not get involved during pregnancy because they said it was the woman’s job, and at some point, they broke down. They broke down because they did not know how to handle things, because, look, no school teaches us what to do when a child comes or when the family grows. The irony and paradox is that for every very important thing in life, we prepare, we educate ourselves, we specialize, but about this, no one talks. No one talks about birth. No one talks about pregnancy. No one talks about how we should prepare for a very important moment in our lives, because when the child comes, everything changes. So, it’s not just your status as a woman becoming a mother that changes, but both your lives change. For you as a mother and for him as a father.

So, believe me, you need information so you can be a team. And for the man, it is very important not to feel left out or helpless. And about family, about the child, about what a baby means, no one teaches us. So it is very important that you actually prepare together. It is about moral support, emotional support, and affective support, because this is the most important thing in a relationship. To support each other on all these levels, not just physically. But you will see during this course how important it is for the man to know his role during pregnancy and birth, and not only then, but especially after, when the woman will anyway be or at least feel overwhelmed.

Good, let’s begin. So, now that I have scared you a little, I don’t want you to be afraid, but I want you to feel responsible, because that is what it is about when we take on the role of parents. A man does not become a father the moment he holds his child for the first time, but already long before conception. Why do I say this? Because when you are already flirting with the idea of becoming parents, it seems that the soul that will choose you is already hovering around you and studying you. Because, as it is said, we choose our parents and before conception we have about nine months to see what would best suit the mission for which we come here on earth. So, a mother does not become a mother only after she holds her child in her arms, that is, after birth. The same goes for the father, because we already become parents the moment we are chosen by another soul.

So, you might have premonitory dreams. You might feel a presence around you. You might, I don’t even know, just be dreamy and images come to you, or you might have... clairvoyant flashes in which you actually feel the presence of another soul in your life. These are signs, very important things that happen, and I just want to warn you that they do happen now. It happens very often that the baby comes unexpectedly, when, let’s say, consciously, we don’t necessarily want a child or don’t think it’s the right time for that child to come. You should know that the timing is always perfect, because that’s how it’s meant to be, because that’s how it was chosen. So, it’s not us who consent at a subconscious or unconscious level, but the child chooses us, and we, at a subtle level, give our consent, because it seems we need this experience in our lives.

Here you see a birth, that is, moments in the first minutes after birth, in which the man is full of gratitude for the miracle of birth and for the woman who gave birth to his child. You should know that these moments are like that. No man who has participated in a beautiful and fulfilling birth has run away, has divorced, or has been scared because of participating in the birth. There are many misogynistic doctors. Yes, this is indeed quite strange, but it happens—they say that men have no place at birth, because they should go elsewhere, to work, for a beer, to friends. You should know that it is not so. Because birth concerns both those involved—the parents—and the baby, after birth, really needs to know both and feel their energy.

So, the fact that fathers have been excluded from such an important event only shows our state of ignorance. That’s exactly what I believe. And it shows not only ignorance, but also a defiance of what is natural and human normality. It is normal for both of us to welcome our child, the fruit of our love. And it is vital for the man to participate. Why? Because if he does not participate, he will feel excluded, and maybe he will not feel this exclusion consciously, but it will eat at him. It will eat at him because he will feel somehow put in second place. He will no longer be in the foreground. Because after the baby is born, everything revolves around the physiological, emotional, and affective needs of the newborn, who comes into a world where he must adapt with the help of his parents. And so, if the man was not included in the welcoming moment—yes, welcomed with flowers, with love, with smiles, with affection—he will no longer find his place in the family. It will be quite difficult. That’s why there is, let’s say, that jealousy when men are told that the child has taken their place. Of course, the child will have a very special place, especially in the first years, and not only then, but later as well. But by excluding the man from this natural family process, we are not doing good, but rather distancing, and there are greater chances for ruptures to occur later or for the relationship to crack and for the understanding between the two partners to limp along.

So, dear men, your place is there, to accompany your loved ones. You don’t have to perform surgery. You don’t have to catch the baby unless you want to. But if you are not by their side, disasters will happen at the hospital; if you are not by their side, there is no one to create that safety framework that, yes, the male provides exactly the safety framework for any female. So, the role of the man, and generally the role of the alpha male, yes, because the alpha male and female have the biological right to reproduce. And so, if the role of the alpha female is one, the role of the alpha male is another. The woman is the link between the two. She communicates with the family, with the tribe, with the clan, and somehow has a very important voice in... exactly in communicating decisions and what happens in the family, while the man has the fantastic role of ensuring the place where all these things happen exactly as they should. So, he ensures our safety so that the relationship works, the couple works, the family grows. So, the man’s role is enormous. If the woman does not feel protected, she will have a terrible birth, because no woman can give birth as long as her basic need is not somehow satisfied—the need for safety. So, the man provides that safety framework, because the man is chosen precisely to protect his woman, his family, and his home. Yes? So, this is the man’s role in a relationship between two conscious and responsible people.

And as I was saying, here I have chosen photos from former students or very suggestive photos, so you can imagine and feel a bit what it means for a couple to experience birth. In this image, the woman is right in the middle of labor, and he is actually giving her time, attention, support. Because the woman is so vulnerable during labor that she needs... And if these basic conditions do not exist, we, as mammals, cannot bring our children into a dangerous world. It’s very simple. I will tell you more when I talk about the secrets of birth. But the man has the most important role in participating in birth, that of protector. A woman alone does not feel safe, does not feel secure to do this alone. That’s why she needs not only moral and emotional support, but also physical support. Yes? To be there, to have her back, to provide the framework in which she can unfold.

Here you see again a very suggestive image. My dears! My dear future mothers, birth is not a walk in the park or a piece of cake or a moment when, yes, it will pass... Birth can become very intense, and precisely then we really need the one who loves us, the one who is by our side, to encourage us, to say a kind word, to hug us, and not to lose, ah, confidence that everything is happening exactly as it should. Because the woman goes through very intense moments. If the man does not know what stage she is in, how she should feel, what she should feel, how she should be, he will panic because he will feel powerless. And if you want to destroy a man, make him feel powerless and unnecessary. This is about psychology and biology. So, the man needs to know his purpose, and his purpose is to remain your pillar exactly in those moments of maximum intensity, when you might cry, when you might complain, when you might make sounds or be so in that situation that you don’t want to communicate. Well, then he must not lose his composure. Then he must be the one who gives you that space, that support, so you can go further. That’s why the intensity of birth cannot be described in words. It can only be felt and soothed with a loving embrace.

All a man has to do is offer that shoulder, those arms, that confidence, those encouragements so that she can continue. Because yes, it will not be easy. Birth is not always just smiles and laughter; at some point, it will become very intense, precisely for those moments of intensity. That’s when... you need to be supported. That’s why the man must be indispensable at birth. And yet, no matter how intense the birth is, know that both of you will experience smiles and tears of joy and all the emotions on this palette. So, no matter where the birth takes place, the father has every right to participate. It is the experience that will unite you as a family, because the men I have spoken to who have participated in births were fascinated. They were fascinated by how strong their woman was, in moments when anyone, if they had a choice, would have left or done anything not to go through that. Because yes, it is intense. That’s why you need to prepare. That’s why the man needs to know how birth unfolds, to know how long it will last, to be able to correctly assess where she is, what she feels, or how he could be helpful. Because if he is not told, if it is not explained, and he does not know, he will not cope. Those are the men who faint because they realize that their role as a man, as a male who must take care of his female, when he feels unnecessary or helpless, yes, he faints. Why? Because biologically, his body sees no other solution than to run from the situation. And yes, fainting is also a way of running from a situation for which he knows no other way out or alternative.

So, if you have heard all your life only scary stories about birth, it is time to find out that it is not so and that it can be different. And you need to find out what the physiology of birth is and how it unfolds, precisely so you can be truly helpful. Here is the most precious gift in the world—the gift of life. Look at this picture. Look at how much devotion and love she gives the baby to her partner. So, for me, how could he not be there? This image is worth a thousand words. It is barbaric to deprive your partner of such emotions. To be the first to touch his child, to be the first to embrace your child, or for both of you to have your hands and energy touch the baby. And not seven nurses and other things. That’s what it’s about. Birth is about giving, about appreciation, about gratitude, about wow moments, which, yes, can be seen in this picture. And speaking of subtle connections between souls, especially souls from the same family, these subtle connections are forged forever in such key moments.

You should know that the child, at birth, after going through the physiological process of birth, which is not simple, needs safety, stability, balanced emotions, which, again, where does he get them from? Only if the woman is balanced, feels safe, the man is there—so the child takes on the emotions of the parents who welcome him into this world. If the parents are well, the child will feel safe in this new world. But if the child does not feel safe because the mother does not feel safe, if the child does not feel safe because he was taken from his mother and the mother could not even touch or see him, or he was shown to her for a second and that was it, then the child will indeed come with a program of, let’s say, “welcome to the world, this is really dangerous.” And he will carry that program for life and never know why he cannot adapt. Well, it’s very simple—because he was not given a good start.

It’s like going somewhere where you don’t feel wanted. The world, instead of welcoming you nicely, starts slapping your bottom, yes? Like we do with babies, yes? To make them cry. So what kind of welcome is that? And you should know that many poets or authors have written about how violent the birth of our children, our infants, our human beings is. You should know that there is more humanity in the birth of animals, our sisters. They do not cause as much violence and pain at birth as we do and as has been propagated for centuries. So it’s not just now, it’s been like this for a long time.

Here again is a sublime image, where the two really feel the intensity of birth. And speaking of this feeling and the magic that happens at birth, I, as a doula—a doula is a companion for the mother, not medically specialized, but she provides psycho-emotional support to help the woman get through that intensity—every time I attended a birth, I left there as if in withdrawal. I was detached from reality, I lost my sleep, my fatigue, my exhaustion, because some births lasted days, not just hours. And when I left, it was as if I had given birth myself. And I was filled with a feeling of wow, gratitude, sublimity, beauty, and love. I have no words to describe it. And I hadn’t given birth myself. So, simply, these emotions are absorbed, received. You leave with them. It’s a bonus, yes? So think that all participants at a birth are filled with the same uplifting and sublime emotions at a birth.

So, if you look at them, from my perspective as a companion, I left with the same feeling. I left enchanted. It was as if the magic took me completely. It was like a vortex that enveloped us all. And yes, I have met many doctors who, in their daily work life, when they attended such a beautiful, non-medicalized birth, where everything flowed and was superb, said, “Wow, how beautiful birth can be!” And I would say, “Yes, birth can be like this, when you, as a couple, are prepared and when they, as doctors, do not intervene.” Not that they don’t intervene to save lives. That’s what they are there for, for your safety. But when they don’t intervene to rush, to whip a labor, to scold the woman, to hurry the whole process, then it becomes magical, sublime, birth becomes superb. But until then, yes, birth can be a medical process, it can be an intervention, and it can be a horror story.

But look, true, beautiful, and fulfilling births look like what you see in this picture now. This picture (wipes her memory) is from some former students who chose to give birth at home, with a midwife and a doula. And here you see the father, who, by the way, is a firefighter and, I think, also a lifeguard, firefighter, yes? So a man who sees many things. Well, I want to say that he cried like a child at the birth of their baby. Yes, so the man’s role is not just to build the family nest. The man is not just the one who ensures the family’s well-being. He is above all the stability and moral support. He is the number one support and protector of those he loves.

Exactly pictures like this express the things I mentioned earlier. So, the relationship of these two young people—because she is young, twenty-one or twenty-two years old, first child—was forged from the moment they were both so involved in welcoming their baby. That’s why I say it is absolutely sublime to see how people grow—not in height or weight, but they grow spiritually and become more responsible, more aware. And it’s beautiful to watch how... a relationship is forged. How the family grows, how understanding exists, yes? Look how she holds her hand on the baby’s head. She holds his hand on the baby’s head. Yes, so it’s a sublime picture. That’s why I chose it. So your man can be the most precious support at birth. Yes, and it is actually his role to be there.

Look, a birth can look like this. Or like this, because this is what the ultimate triumph together looks like. Together, yes, because you conceived together, you can welcome the baby together, because your place is together, yes, because you chose this. A picture that expresses gratitude and love for the feminine principle, for what it means—the power of a woman to procreate, to perpetuate humanity. Because, dear men, the moment you witness a birth, you will be changed forever. And I’m not talking about births that traumatize you, but births that actually increase your respect and admiration for the woman by your side.

Here you see a picture from the very first seconds after birth, when the emotions are absolutely overwhelming. So, rarely have I not cried at a birth, because it is so emotional that I cannot express it in words. There is another thing that happens at birth: you become addicted. It is so beautiful that I realize I became who I am today because I attended several births, yes, which made me want to become addicted to the magic that happens at birth—it creates addiction. And by the way, just to live those moments, I would have 11 more children. A football team, just to have it. Because it is fantastic, because no other experience in this life will ever be as intense as that moment when the child comes, when he is born, when he lands on earth, when you hold him for the first time in your arms, and when he looks into your eyes for the first time. Believe me, you have never experienced anything as intense as you will then. And I’m not just talking about the mother, who, yes, goes through some intensities, but about everyone, everyone who participates. It’s as if they all live the same experiences, even if not physically. That emotion envelops everyone. And yes, it’s like a drug that creates addiction. That good and natural addiction, the dopamine we probably all crave. And yes, bonds are forged, love grows, unity grows. This idea of togetherness is fantastic. It is forged.

Here again is an extraordinary picture, also from the very first seconds after the baby is born. And yes, very intense. There’s no point in saying more. Enjoy the picture. And indeed, every time I attended a birth, I left with a profound sense of gratitude. Because it is, it is divine what happens at a birth. I told you, it creates addiction. And how could someone as important as you, the parents, be absent? So it is impossible to miss something like this. It should be impossible. Yes, a picture that says a lot. Look at how he looks at her. How much admiration! How much power is in that woman who gives birth! And speaking of this, I have had many, many women who did not have beautiful births the first time, or the second, or the third. And when they managed to have a natural, beautiful, and fulfilling birth, it was as if they were taking revenge for all the other births that were not like that because it was rushed, because it was, let’s say, induced, because they were not left alone or supported. A woman has the right to experience birth this way, because if not, she falls into depression. That is why it is a biological program we have when we give birth to a child. If we do not respect that biological program, our hormones no longer function as they should. And that means you fall into postpartum depression when the biological process could not happen because it was not allowed, there was no patience, the woman was not supported. That’s why most births are the way they are, because this respect, this sacredness of birth, has been lost.

Joy, yes, joy—this is a few hours after a birth, joy that everything is exactly as it should be. Here, everyone was crying. Yes, absolutely beautiful pictures. There’s no reason to want to miss something like this. I searched for a long time for such pictures, so what you see here are truly pearls made by photographers experienced in capturing magical moments. Yes, by the way, don’t forget your video camera or at least your phone at the birth, and ask someone to take pictures, because birth photos can be so beautiful. And here? Do you think he is suffering? No. He is there, body and soul, by her side. And he is not suffering, but simply amazed at how strong a woman is when she brings a child into the world. Yes, this is what it looks like after the baby is born. Everything is fine. When it ends well. It is a huge triumph, and for the father, deeply moved by the magic of birth. Yes. This is what togetherness means. And here, very deep things are forged. Tears of happiness at the first meeting. This is how it should be. To welcome our children into this world with love, gentleness, warmth. With care. And again, here is a father whose hands will be the first to touch the fruit of their love.

Do you know that the hand emits energy? The child feels who touches him, whether he is touched with love or indifference. How is the first touch in this world? Whose should be the first touch in this world? No, the mother’s and father’s hands, of course. It’s magic. Think that you are the first to touch your own child. He has never been touched before. So does it matter how you touch him? Of course. Or does it matter that someone washes him in the sink like a sack of potatoes? It matters. Yes. So you can be the first to touch your child when he comes into the world. And yes, it’s a wow, magical moment. Look, protection! Yes, that’s what you symbolize, men, for us, women, for your family, for your children. That’s what is needed. That’s why a woman should not give birth alone, abandoned, humiliated, insulted. A woman must have her man by her side. Because then those things no longer happen.

Pure happiness. Yes, it’s a bundle of pure happiness. And yes, it will change your life. You’ll see. This is what love means. To have another child there who loves his mother and caresses her while another sister or brother is coming. This means emotional, moral, psychological, physical support for the mother, who, by the way, as I’ve said, goes through the most intense moments of her life. This is love, pure love. And yes, these are the most intense moments in life, I confirm, because it is almost unimaginable how intense it can be, but also how beautiful. And now you wonder if older brothers or sisters should attend the birth? What do you think? What is this little girl doing when she holds her brother or sister? Believe me, it imprints an unforgettable experience for life. And it’s not that she will be traumatized, because we don’t bring a child to a birth where the mother is screaming in pain. It is simply a moment in which the little girl will surely see birth as something natural and physiological, not as a trauma. Yes? Even if it is intense...

The screams and cries of pain happen when births are rushed, induced, provoked, whipped. And then, yes, it hurts. When we intervene with oxytocin, with augmentations, with all sorts of things, yes, then it can become a matter of screaming and yelling. But otherwise, a child who holds his own brother or sister will never forget this wonderful experience. And surely, he will not have the horror stories we have gathered from others who have witnessed such things.

And now, if you want your children not to have, let’s say, outbursts of rivalry, yes, outbursts of jealousy, you need to include them, include them already during pregnancy, talk a lot, let them caress your belly, introduce them to the baby in the belly, let them talk to him—that’s what inclusion means, yes? The more you exclude children from this process, the more they will develop an aversion to the one who might come to take their place. Because the mother cannot split herself in two, yes? When another baby comes, it’s clear that the baby takes up attention and somehow steals some of the attention from the older sister or brother.

So, by the way, I stand by what I say, that likewise, pets should not be excluded or thrown out on the street or given away. Because, believe me, you are used to them, the child has no problem with this. And many of the tests for toxoplasmosis and all the rest are exaggerations of our modernism. I’m not denying that there are real problems, but I know hundreds of women who were, let’s say, diagnosed in an interesting way, yes, with toxoplasmosis and other problems, but they had absolutely no symptoms or anything unpleasant.

And yes, it is normal for a child to come into a family that already had a dog or a cat, or three cats, or other animals, and for the animals to be very interested and have no problem with that child. And believe me, if the child did not like animals, if the child did not like pets, he certainly would not choose a family that already has a dog or a cat. So yes, your pets stay with you. And yes, don’t forget to introduce the baby to them when you come home from the hospital, or if you give birth at home, accompanied by a doula and a midwife, there must be that moment of introduction.

So we do not exclude anyone, but include them in our lives, because that’s what they chose—to be included, not excluded. Here you see another baby helping at birth. You can see from the intensity of the birth and what a real birth means, not what we see in movies. Screams, shouts, curses. And here, again, a helper at birth. A very reliable helper. Yes, this is how we should welcome our brothers or sisters. Yes, this is how it should be. But yes, now we are fighting with more and more unnatural and strange things. But yes, when you see birth from another perspective, you can see its beauty. And I wish you all beautiful and fulfilling births, because they will transform your life into a miracle and into that kind of unconditional love. So continue the journey together. Thank you.
