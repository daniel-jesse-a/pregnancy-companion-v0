Hello, my dear! I am Ditta Depner and I am glad to see you at this course about breathing during labor. Now I will present to you the breathing technique for dilation, because I have divided labor into two parts: first, the dilation of the cervix, and the second stage of labor is the expulsion of the baby. In this course, I will talk to you about an imagery technique to help you go through labor with ease, without pain, and without too much discomfort. That’s why I will explain in this course how and what would be the optimal position for a woman during dilation contractions. I will describe the technique in detail so you know exactly what to do and how to breathe. I will explain exactly how to inhale, exactly how to exhale, how many times this breathing should be performed, and how to take breaks between breaths. I will also tell you about how long a dilation contraction lasts, because these initial contractions are very different from expulsion contractions. And yes, we will discuss what this breathing technique helps with and when to practice it already during pregnancy.

Good, let’s begin! So today we are discussing breathing during dilation. It would be good to have a notebook and a pencil with you to write these things down because they will be useful. How do you breathe during dilation contractions to reduce discomfort? What you see in the image is labor experienced together, because that’s the beautiful way and that’s how a woman needs support and encouragement. And as you see, it’s not like in the movies, but exactly like in reality. Contractions should not make a woman scream in pain, because those are already contractions either induced by artificial oxytocin. We will discuss artificial oxytocin in the course about contractions, and a woman, when she has contractions, will feel sensations of pressure, pain, pulling upwards. Girls already know, if you’ve had menstrual cramps, you know more or less what the sensation is, so that’s about the kind of pain you feel during a contraction.

During contractions, it is very important to breathe and not to hold your breath. If you hold your breath, it will hurt even more. If you hold your breath, you actually block the flow and the contractions become more painful because you tense all the muscles in your body. It’s exactly that feeling we have when we say: “It hurts!” And at that moment, you see, I’m not breathing now either, we hold our breath. That is the biggest mistake, and women who don’t know this practice it. And then, of course, labor becomes a torment. Because if you hold your breath, you tense all the muscles in your body, including the uterine muscles, because the uterus has muscles, and those muscles are the ones that make the contraction. When you tense a muscle and don’t let it contract. And we will discuss contraction in the course about contractions, I recommend you watch it to understand the physiology of the female body.

When you tense and involuntarily contract your muscles because you are no longer breathing, at that moment, the contractions become painful because the uterus can no longer perform that upward and pressing movement to push the baby out, because that’s what the uterus knows to do. So, please, write down and remember that when a contraction comes, you breathe and do not block your breath. It is very important to remember this, and if you don’t, have someone remind you, like your partner, because it is very important in those moments to be very connected with your body and to do this breathing, this breathing. I have had many examples and I have tested on myself how this type of breathing works, which I have also named in a somewhat illustrative way, you’ll see immediately. It helps a lot because it reduces the sensation of pain. I tried to hold my breath during a contraction and the contractions squeezed tears out of me, yes? And when I breathed through them, I was really fine and could manage them. So the number one mistake of all women who go into labor and are scared of contractions because they don’t know exactly what it means, how long it lasts, what triggers it, and what actually hurts in a contraction, is this major mistake – they hold their breath. So, you breathe when a contraction comes.

The breathing technique for dilation contractions is a technique I created especially and tested on myself and thousands of pregnant women, who confirmed the same thing to me, that it works. I called it the gentle breath, because it is a light breath, not a (sharp sound) or (previous sound), yes? As we learn in other courses, because all those types of breathing, they hyperventilate you, put you in a state of agitation, and your pulse rises. You don’t need that. That’s why I called it the gentle breath, because it is gradual. We don’t make it choppy, we don’t hold it, we don’t exaggerate. We simply breathe with a pink puff on our lips. See, that pink puff is a feather or a down or a— a very small and light feather that you will actually need to imagine.

What is the position you should take when you have contractions? Exactly as you see in this image, I want you to sit comfortably and I actually say you should only choose comfortable positions during labor, because you are NOT being punished. You are allowed to sit however you want. Women who lie on their backs experience the most painful contractions. Why? Because the position on the back, first of all, is a wrong position. No woman would spend her labor on her back unless forced. No woman stays in bed because she is not sick, and all women, if their freedom of movement is not restricted, they get up, walk, move, sit in a certain way. They do not lie down, especially not on their backs. The best option is to lie down, as I show in this image, with your back at forty-five degrees, with your knees on a pillow, raised, because if you stretch them out, you also stretch the little muscles on your belly and uterus. So, with your back at forty-five degrees, with your knees bent and a pillow underneath – you don’t need to buy a triangular pillow, two or three pillows are enough – anyway, I recommend you buy more pillows than usual, because during birth and afterwards, after the baby comes, you will need many pillows to be comfortable during those hours when you will be breastfeeding non-stop.

Good, back to the point. The position should be like this, because otherwise you tense your belly and the breathing is no longer effective and you’ll wonder why it hurts. So contractions should never be experienced on your back. Why? Because you tense your belly and will clearly experience pain. So please sit comfortably, like in an armchair, and use pillows so your torso and knees are raised. Exactly as in the picture. Maybe even take a picture with your phone, so you have this reference in mind. Close your eyes and now imagine that pink feather. Can you see it? Perfect.

Take that pink feather and place it now on your lips. Because you need this pink feather to measure the intensity with which you inhale and exhale. Exactly as shown in that picture. I couldn’t find a better one. It’s a bit, well, sexy, but that’s it. I couldn’t find a more suggestive picture to show you exactly how that feather should be placed. So, we place the imaginary feather, yes, on the lips or right here in front of the nose, and we inhale slowly and gradually. Of course, with your eyes closed, with the imaginary feather on your lips. And inhale slowly and gradually, so that the imaginary pink puff on your lips does not move. And you inhale slowly and gradually until your lungs are full. Good. See that upward arrow? Yes. We inhale slowly and gradually. We don’t do inhalations like this (sharp inhalation sound), yes, we don’t take in all the air at once, but we inhale slowly, very gently, almost imperceptibly, precisely so as not to inhale or suck in the imaginary feather from your lips. That’s why I suggested this image with the feather, because when you imagine that pink feather is on your lips, you will temper your inhalation and do it gradually and slowly. Perfect! So, after you inhale until your lungs are full... The feather doesn’t move, imaginary, yes? Exactly when your lungs are full, don’t stop, but exhale slowly and gradually, so that again, the imaginary pink puff on your lips does not move until you empty your lungs completely.

So, I repeat, inhale gradually and slowly until your lungs are full and exhale slowly and gradually, without the feather moving from your lips. Because the feather is very light, a stronger air current would dislodge it. That’s why I asked you to imagine that feather and place it on your lips. So, inhale, exhale, and the breathing is smooth and gentle. The mind is relaxed and everything flows naturally, without forcing, without thinking about all sorts of constraints, without counting. Please, I didn’t say anything about counting. Yes? I don’t want us to have a contest about who can hold their breath longer, because we don’t hold it, we simply inhale, exhale. Inhalation and exhalation are free and easy. Nothing is forced. I don’t hold my exhalation when I reach empty, yes, when there’s nothing left in my lungs. I don’t hold my inhalation when I reach full, when my lungs are full. So everything is smooth, like a wave. Yes? Perfect!

And now, this technique is repeated twice. Why twice and not five times? Why not once? Because that’s how long a cervical dilation contraction lasts. At the beginning, about twenty seconds, when it intensifies, maximum thirty seconds. So, to understand, look a bit at the image on your screen and see: we inhale, see the arrow, so we inhale gradually, so that the imaginary pink puff on your lips does not move until your lungs are full, then you exhale slowly and gradually, see the arrow down, until you empty your lungs, then inhale again, again gently and gradually, without jerking, without stopping, without holding your breath, and exhale again, just as gradually and slowly, until your lungs are empty. That’s about the interval in which the contraction will manifest. And after the contraction is over, even if you haven’t done this inhale-exhale, inhale-exhale cycle, you stop and breathe freely. Because this slower inhalation and this slow, gradual exhalation make you lose your breath. That is, if you repeated more than twice, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, you would run out of air, and that doesn’t help you. So we only breathe as long as the contraction lasts. Usually, in two series, that is, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. Done, the contraction has passed. Breathe freely. So you don’t have to force yourself, you don’t have to count, you don’t have to do anything but observe yourself, breathe, and stop when the contraction stops.

When do you start? Well, when the contraction starts. How will you feel it? You will definitely feel it and that’s why it’s very important to also take the contractions course, to understand a bit what a contraction is, when it manifests, how it manifests, how it appears, how to recognize it, how to know if it’s false, how to know if it’s real. So you find out all these things in the course about contractions. But when you feel you have a contraction, whether you are at the beginning of labor or at the end of labor, or even during pregnancy you might experience some contractions, it’s perfect. You can perform this breathing technique whenever you have a contraction, whether during pregnancy or in full labor. So inhale and exhale. And inhale once more and exhale once more. And the contraction is over. Breathe freely, open your eyes again, talk to your partner, joke or not, be silent or not, simply enjoy your labor, because with each contraction, your baby is closer to being in your arms. Soon! Good.

So, when do we breathe with the gentle breath, with a pink puff on the lips, during dilation contractions? Only when you have a contraction. Otherwise, breathe normally.

And another very important cue so your partner knows you are breathing through a contraction. We will have a kind of sign that we establish now together, so he knows, so he doesn’t come to ask you, “Honey, where did you put the phone charger?” Or you know, men can’t find their things and then they ask. Well, when she has her eyes closed, don’t come to ask her anything, because we don’t wake a woman from the trance she is in during labor. And as labor progresses, that trance becomes stronger and more helpful. And I will tell you about these signs in another course, so you can recognize what stage of labor you are in and how much longer until you give birth. So, when she has her eyes closed... We keep quiet because she is in labor. She is probably breathing through a contraction. And anyway, the man is her protector, and no one comes to ask her anything, because you, men, will be the interface, let’s say, in communication with the pregnant woman or the couple about to bring their child into the world.

So all discussions, whether medical, informational, or “oh, you need to fill out another form,” all these things are handled by the partner, and she must not be disturbed, especially when she has contractions, because the more precious time we lose during these contractions, when the body is actually working to create dilation, the longer the whole labor process will be. And labor is tiring, because it is an extraordinary energy expenditure. It is said that, energetically speaking, a woman in labor covers, energetically, a marathon. So, after running about twenty-six miles, you have a certain state. That’s exactly the state a woman has after labor. So it is work. That’s why it’s called labor, from “travail” in French. That’s why it is so important that you don’t, or don’t let anyone disturb this labor, because every contraction is extremely important in advancing labor toward birth.

Good. This breathing technique, that is, the gentle breath with a pink puff on the lips, as I called it, will help you with easy dilation and, at the same time, relaxation, which will lead to a reduction in physical discomfort. So not only does it help with dilation, but it also gives you those rest periods when the body, when it relaxes, recovers.

And now, when should you practice this type of breathing? Many women say, “Oh, it’s fine, I understood how to do it. I’ll do it at birth.” Wrong. If something doesn’t become second nature, that is, if it doesn’t become a habit, you do it very mentally and focused. I need you to practice this breathing twice a day. No need for more. But these two times a day, in the morning and evening, when you get in bed or before you get out of bed, these two exercises will help you prepare so that when labor comes, you don’t have to think and activate... What? Do you remember the lesson about the secrets of birth? What was forbidden to activate? The mind. If you don’t remember the lesson about the secrets of birth, please go back to that lesson in the basic course and go through it.

Because I have arranged all these videos in a certain order, precisely so you understand things gradually. So don’t skip them, don’t just go through them. “Oh, this doesn’t interest me.” Go through them all, because each one gives you one more thing, one more piece of information, so we can build on a solid foundation.

So, doing this every morning, for example, let’s say the alarm rings, yes? And you have to wake up. Set the alarm five minutes earlier, because it won’t take more than five minutes. Why? The breathing will take twenty, thirty seconds, then you take a break until your breath returns to normal. Let’s say you take a one-minute break until your breath returns to normal, then you do another inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, and take another break until your breath returns. It is enough if you do this in the morning before getting out of bed and in the evening after you get in bed and before you fall asleep. This will teach not only your mind but also your body to do these breaths automatically, because you need to train your breathing and your mind. Because the mind here needs training so you are ready exactly when labor starts.

If, for example, you choose now and say, “Oh, I don’t need to do this!” Know that many women have regretted not taking two minutes a day to do this breathing, because during birth they panicked so much that they were like: “Oh no, what did Ditta say? How was I supposed to breathe? I don’t remember, where do I look? Which notebook?” So you enter a chaos like this, from which you only get out if you manage to self-regulate, to calm yourself. That’s why I recommend, starting today, to do these two breaths: in the morning before getting out of bed and in the evening before falling asleep. It’s very simple, nothing complicated. Don’t forget, when you inhale, even if you don’t have the pillows, to raise your knees, yes, and keep your belly as relaxed as possible, lying at at least a forty-five-degree angle. And don’t forget to take a break after each series and know that during that break you breathe freely until your breath returns to normal. So it’s very simple. The imaginary contraction has come. I start to inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale. I stop because that’s how long a contraction lasts and I regulate my breath again and breathe freely, until I feel I can do a second round of the pink feather breathing technique.

The technique must become routine so you do it automatically, without thinking, because that’s where you need to get. To do something without thinking, without rationalizing. Simply, your body should be so used to it that when you think, “OK, now I breathe through a contraction!” it already does it automatically, without activating the mind, without having to remember how the breathing was, how it was explained, let me look again. I don’t want birth to happen in front of a screen, in front of a course, in front of a notebook. Because that’s the mistake I made at my first birth. I was with the notebooks and books open on my knees, searching about contractions and not understanding why the contractions hurt so much. Because the technique I learned then at HypnoBirthing didn’t work. That’s why I invented this technique, because it works.

So, do this exercise twice a day, morning and evening, so it becomes a reflex. And I guarantee (three-second pause) that you will go through labor with a smile on your face. Those movies where the woman screams, yells, and curses... Those are movies where, yes, birth has to be presented as a kind of boogeyman. You will never see movies with gentle births, with women experiencing ecstasy, not only until they hold their baby in their arms, but even after... You will only see that in my courses. Because, yes, they exist and that’s what a prepared and, let’s say, informed birth looks like. Those births, which have to be sensational on TV, will be with cursing, with other things, but not this.

So, please, do yourself a favor and repeat this breathing technique with the pink puff on your lips, so it becomes automatic. And you’ll see, you’ll thank me. But you don’t have to thank me. Thank yourself and thank your baby for bringing you to this course and for learning this technique and for being willing to sacrifice two minutes a day to train yourself. Good luck!
