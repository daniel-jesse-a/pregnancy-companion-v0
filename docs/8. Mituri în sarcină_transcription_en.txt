Hello, my dear! I am glad that you are attending this course about myths in pregnancy. Today, I will talk to you about the emotional causes that trigger unpleasant symptoms. We will discuss what constipation, anemia, gestational diabetes, thrombophilia, urinary incontinence mean, the myth about hair loss or hair dyeing, pets and babies and how they do or do not get along. We will also talk about sex, sun and sea, about natural supplements and cosmetics, about the fears that arise during pregnancy, about what worries us when we think about pregnancy, such as stretch marks or excessive weight gain, fever, colds, fear of childbirth or fear of pain during childbirth. And there are other fears as well, such as fear of miscarriage or fear of having children. And, as a conclusion, we will also talk a little about medical language in pregnancy and childbirth. So, welcome to the course about myths in pregnancy. I will present to you all the myths I have encountered in these decades of experience with pregnant women and with the medical system, which fantastically propagates certain myths, and I am amazed myself at how these myths still persist. 

Let’s see what the causes of all problems during pregnancy are. Why do only some women suffer during pregnancy, while others enjoy it? Why is there this discrepancy? Why is there the myth that, for example, during pregnancy you must feel pain? Many women write to me daily to ask... For example, if I have no problems during pregnancy, no nausea, I don’t feel sick, I feel good, does that mean my pregnancy is not okay, or that I lost it, or that I am not pregnant? We have reached a point where, nowadays, these myths practically dictate whether you are pregnant or not. There are many women who wonder if something is wrong with their pregnancy as long as they do not suffer. Surprise! A woman, when she is pregnant, does not have to suffer. She can live her pregnancy with joy and zest for life, because that is what it is about. Pregnancy is not a disease that ruins a woman’s body. So then, why do some women suffer, while others have no problems at all?

What happens in cases where, let’s say, a woman starts to suffer is, let’s say, also due to the modern medical approach. Even if “modern” sounds good, it does not mean it is what is needed. Because the modern medical approach to pregnancy considers the pregnant woman as sick, and her body as a machine that must be obsessively serviced and overanalyzed. Why? Because modern, allopathic medicine does not make the connection between body, soul, and psyche. In allopathic medicine, we treat the body as a machine that must be checked or, anyway, parts must be replaced from time to time because they break. No one asks why it breaks. Even with a car, you ask why it broke, and there are explanations: wear and tear, improper use, and so on. When the body gets sick, no one asks you: “But what did you do to get sick?” And that is a very important question, because we do not take responsibility for our body’s illness at all.

We always believe that someone outside of us is to blame. A virus, something, the wind, the draft, those typical Romanian things that influence us and do something to us. Just as, look, women have started to believe that during pregnancy they must suffer from nausea and feel sick and not feel well, instead of thinking that these things are not normal. When you do not feel well during pregnancy, the body just wants to draw your attention to some emotional aspects. But if you look at the body from the point of view of allopathic medicine and do not turn to, let’s say, a holistic medicine, then clearly you have no, let’s say, chance to really understand what the body wants to tell you. Allopathic medicine has only one solution for all your problems during pregnancy: pills and tablets. And if not? A shrug. Why do you feel bad? Well, that’s how all women feel. Wrong. It is not true. Not all women suffer when they become pregnant. Because pregnancy is not a disease. And now we have alternatives, of course, to this allopathic medicine that fills you with pills and tablets and doctor visits, who will tell you yes, it’s normal to feel bad. Take this pill.

Now let’s see a bit, when we make a correct correlation between body, soul, and psyche, what are the causes of all problems in pregnancy? Yes, you read that right: childhood memories. I know it sounds strange. You’d think we’re doing history here. But yes, the body does not forget, because it will remember everything you went through in your childhood, even that early childhood from which we no longer have conscious memory.

Now let’s see what helpful questions I have for you, so you can figure out where this nausea, bad state, these fears that come up are coming from. Please write down these three questions or take a picture and explore these three questions. I want you to ask yourself what you think about yourself now, during pregnancy. How do you expect this pregnancy to evolve? What is your opinion about yourself? How do you feel? How do you manifest yourself? It is very important to write these things down so we can further explore the causes of these problems that have appeared in your pregnancy. Then, point two. Please try to remember with your conscious mind anything about your childhood, anything beautiful, anything sad, anything that comes to mind. Because that thing is clearly very important. Think about how you were when you were little. What do you remember when you think of yourself as a child? Because describing those moments you lived as a child will describe very well what your body is reliving now.

It is amazing how much we repeat things from our own childhood experiences. The third question I would like you to explore is: What does your subconscious mind know? That is, you do not remember these things, but your subconscious mind remembers how you came, how your mother’s pregnancy with you was. What did your mother think? What did your mother experience not only during pregnancy, but also later, after your birth? And how were your first three years of life? Because after two and a half years, we start, with our conscious mind, to have some memories. But until then, everything that governs us is what happened, not here, but somehow in our subconscious mind. So we do not remember these things, but we can explore to see what our subconscious mind knows about our coming, about our stay in the womb, and about pregnancy and the first three years of life.

The more you manage to declassify, to unlock these files you do not consciously know, the easier it will be to unearth things that affect you now. Although it may sound strange to say that I have nausea because, I don’t know, my mother lived her pregnancy with me in fear, because she did not want me, because I did not come at a good time, because she did not have a good relationship with my father and maybe they stayed together because of me, because I appeared. So you will answer many of the questions that are now arising when you explore these answers from early childhood. So, the cause of all problems in pregnancy are emotional conflicts.

Which ones? Our emotional conflicts are created by the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. Because not only what we know now, what we reason, influences us, but also what drives us from behind, without us knowing exactly what it is. It influences our life, destiny, abilities, reactions. Everything we are, in fact. That is why I suggest you start your most fascinating journey right now, today, by exploring your emotional conflicts, especially those you do not remember, which happened in that period where we did not store these experiences in the conscious mind. But, in pregnancy, you receive this gift. You receive the gift of being able to declassify moments that your conscious mind does not remember. So, welcome to a journey of exploring your unseen, hidden mind, your classified mind, where we do not have access because those memories were, as if in a movie, classified and no one touches them.

The problem is that they have a great influence on us. This is the most important thing I want you to realize today. And if you have understood this mechanism, it will be very easy for you from now on to discover the causes of your problems during pregnancy.

Now I want to teach you how to associate emotional conflicts with your body’s symptoms. That is, every conflict in our head, in our emotional self, triggers certain symptoms in the body. If, for example, I am in a situation that I simply cannot understand, cannot, um, digest—and I use a very important word here—and listen to the words you say to yourself, because they are very important. So, when I am in a situation I cannot swallow, cannot digest, what will my body manifest? It will manifest feelings, sensations of nausea, sensations of vomiting because you cannot digest, not physically, the food you ingest, but the situation you are in. And now you will say: But, well, how can I digest a situation? Well, just as I digest food. In our mind, the function of our body to digest food is associated with digesting conflicts. It is the same thing, because it affects our digestion, which metabolizes food and transforms it from food into energy.

Well, when there is an experience in our life that cannot be digested, that is indigestible, our body throws it out, as if it wants to get rid of that experience. Good. How do you know? There are many associations. I gave you just a simple example, but there are manuals, a multitude of manuals, that I could say should come with us when we are born. But we do not come with a manual. But there is this user manual for the human body, because, regardless of where we were born, when we were born, whether we are women or men, our body tells us every time why it suffers. If you manage to associate these emotions, conflicts with the symptoms your body manifests, you will learn to listen to your body, to see what it tells you, what it transmits, what it says. And it is very important, because the body is your best friend, your most loyal friend. It does not deceive you, it does not trick you.

It just shows you where there is an emotional conflict that already disrupts a very important process in your body. Perfect! So look for those dictionaries, those user manuals for the human body. They are written by hundreds of authors. I recommend for starters, yes, Jacques Martel’s Dictionary of Diseases. There is also Lisw bzw. Hey, who wrote many such correlations. You will find many, many authors and many books that talk about this, about the connection between emotions and diagnoses and the diseases we create.

How do we create them? Well, very simply. By having an emotional conflict, we live a state. That state affects the proper functioning of the body or even damages organs. Yes? Good. Look for the book that you can open when needed, for every symptom. Even when we sneeze, the body is telling us something. When we have a cold, the body tells us, hello, you need a break. When we cannot digest, we will have symptoms of nausea, stomach pain. I know other variants, but all, but all, really all, have an explanation. And you must discover this explanation. I cannot give you recipes about what and how, because each case is particular. Just as each person can suffer very differently in a certain situation. Let’s say, if two people go through the same thing in life, they will react very differently. One may not digest, another may, I don’t know, be able to easily integrate the experience and will not create an emotional conflict in their mind. So it depends on how we are built and what our experiences have been so far.

So, my dear, all your hidden and unexpressed emotions—and I mean exactly those memories from conception to two or three years old—will manifest through unpleasant symptoms. So that you can heal them necessarily before the birth of your child. Why? Why before the birth of the child? Because if you leave them, the child will take them on just as you took them from your mother, just as your mother took them from your grandmother, just as your grandmother took them from your great-grandmother. And so we have a transgenerational chain that goes up to seven generations of inheritances. Think that you are the first in this whole chain of generations who stops this transmission, which is not necessarily a joy, to keep receiving things that your grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on, lived.

So, my dear, you have a very important role. Besides being a mother or future mother, because you are already a mother, because you have been chosen by a soul, you now have the motivation to bring to the surface all these hidden and unexpressed emotions, in order to resolve them before birth. Why? If you leave them, not only do you pass them on, but they will further generate unpleasant symptoms and complications exactly where you do not want them, at birth. So everything that is not resolved during pregnancy and what comes to the surface and torments you needs healing before birth. If not, there will be complications at birth. Like blockages. Dozens of women write to me daily. Why? Because they do not understand why labor got stuck, why dilation did not progress. Why? Because they had unresolved, hidden, unexpressed issues. So now is your chance not to go into labor unprepared.

Good, let’s see what is the subtle cause of constipation during pregnancy. When we get constipated—and this is not only valid during pregnancy. We will see why these things happen more frequently during pregnancy. Because constipation indicates the fear of relaxing, the tendency to keep things as they are, and difficulty accepting the new. Knowing that the arrival of a child will bring major changes in life, the woman enters another stage of life, in which she can have two reactions. To go confidently towards this new... area or to put on the brakes and be afraid of what will happen. That is, I don’t know what will be, it is unknown. How could I still keep something I already have? Yes, so, this fear of accepting the new in our life is a widespread thing. Why does constipation appear in pregnant women? Because, being in a situation that generates such conflicts, it is a very common situation, because all women who become pregnant think: “Oh no, how can I not have my life change one hundred and eighty degrees? How can I prepare for this new stage without stressing, without, um, wanting to keep things as they were?”

So, ask yourself what you are afraid of and look with confidence and courage at the fears that have appeared. Let’s see what it means when a woman finds out she is anemic. Anemia in pregnancy—It also means lack of joy, of life, and lack of power or courage to face life’s difficulties. Here, when we become anemic, we perpetuate a wrong belief of lack of value. We no longer value ourselves. We feel we are worth nothing. Pay attention to words, because people who repeat certain words often enough implement states in themselves. Anemia shows a lack of confidence in one’s own strength, great fragility, helplessness, lack of motivation, and lack of connection with blood relatives. When you become anemic, you no longer find your roots, and when you no longer have roots, you no longer have strength. You are like a leaf in the wind. And this manifests as severe anemia. So, when you no longer feel your roots with your relatives because they judge you, do not understand you, condemn you for, let’s say, the decisions you want to make, you devalue yourself. Because it is as if you cut your roots to survive, yes? So we become anemic because our courage and sense of belonging decrease, fragility increases, yes?

What can you do when you realize where, let’s say, from an emotional point of view, this state of anemia, of lack of strength comes from? Repeat and become aware that you can live your life with joy and enthusiasm and that you alone validate your own needs and can express them with courage and responsibility. Take a picture of this slide to have these key ideas, but you will surely find other key ideas in the dictionaries you will consult to learn more about anemia.

The myth of gestational diabetes. Here I really emphasized the idea that this myth, that a woman when pregnant must at least be suspected of diabetes, is not true. The fact that a woman is pregnant, indeed, her tests and blood glucose values will change a bit. But that is also because, think about it, for nine months you no longer lose blood, you accumulate it. And plus, a feeling develops there that is very much related to love. Yes, a baby is developing in your womb. Many, many things change in your fragile psyche during pregnancy. And so, if there really is a real suspicion of diabetes, it means that somewhere, at the emotional level, you are experiencing intense inner sadness, especially in this fragile period of your life. You feel deprived of love, of tenderness. You become petrified by so much bitterness. You probably do not receive enough from those around you, from whom you expect, from your partner, from your family. You resist to cope with life’s difficulties. You fight to get a little attention. It is that love you do not really know how to receive, because you feel you must endure hard situations. That feeling of heaviness is again something that weighs heavily in the balance of “I cling to situations and people so as not to be alone.” So here, you see, the fear of loneliness appears, the fear to cling to someone because you no longer find stability within yourself.

And now, what can you become aware of after you realize where these things come from, from what period of childhood, where some programs of lack of love were activated? You can repeat some affirmations and please take a picture. I open myself to love and the flow of life, I feel safe and let go of stubbornness. That stubbornness that makes you believe things you impose on yourself. I am full of spontaneity and joy. Spontaneity is extraordinary. It is when you accept yourself exactly as you are and are authentic. When you are authentic, you will be spontaneous and vice versa. And you will stop your own self-destructive actions, because you regain your zest for life and no longer desperately cling to the love you may not receive from whom you want. So, repeat these phrases and make them a kind of mantra every day or put them on your phone so you see them often or write them on notes and stick them around your house, yes, in the kitchen, in the bathroom, on the mirror, yes? With the phrases written in red.

The myth of thrombophilia in pregnancy. Oh, here we have, at least in Romania, a big trend about thrombophilia. And I have talked in other recorded courses about this trend. And now I want to clarify some things for you. Blood is what starts our heart at about twenty-one days after conception. So the heart does not start first. The blood pumps this liquid into the heart and gets it going. So blood is pumped into the heart, giving it life. So, what does blood do? Blood is the fuel that keeps us alive and shows exactly our inner state, that is, zest for life, joy of living. When a woman suffers, is sad, becomes pessimistic, the blood, which is the fuel of happiness and joy of living, will thicken, will be slower, thicker, not fluid and lively. And things slow down from there. Lack of zest for life, lack of enthusiasm, lack of joy of living. It can happen, after several miscarriages, that a woman no longer wants to fulfill her role as a woman, because she loses pregnancies and blames herself. And then there is also that conflict that is created with blood relatives, with the clan, with the family. Because it is about the feeling of belonging. I experience a blockage because life no longer flows through me easily. Or when you cling to a toxic relationship, everything is hard. So pay attention to the words you say often, because they describe exactly the state you are in. When everything is hard, it is clear that you are no longer full of life and handling everything as you did before.

What can you do? Well, you need to regain your zest for life and joy of living. So accept to feel again the zest for life and joy. Embrace freedom and creativity and accept to open yourself to the new. I trust. That is, what can you do to come back to life? Surrender. Surrender to what? To life. And life flows. Trust that your life flows exactly in the direction it should. When you surrender, life will beautifully guide you to your mission, to your place, to what you must live as destiny. Because that is why we come. The more you resist, the more life will try to put you on track. But you, from that force and resistance, will make your life hard. Yes? Life flows. Find that flow to go with. Go with the flow. Yes? It sounds very nice in English.

So, my dear, thrombophilia is not inherited. In very few cases. There, too, are inherited conflicts from your family. But women who lose pregnancies, who are sad, who cling to a toxic relationship, who want to save a marriage with a child, that is where the conflict is. The conflict of devaluation, thickening of the blood, loss of zest for life and joy. So it is not that aspirin that will help you, but the awareness of the conflict. So, if your doctor confused you that you have thrombophilia and you did seven thousand tests and in fact it is neither this nor that. Believe me, you have nothing, it was just your state of heaviness, because you were in a hard period of your life. And yes, that is how you reacted. That is how all women react. Yes, in hard times. So seek to regain your joy of living and everything will resolve.

Many women have an incredible fear of childbirth, because they think that after birth comes urinary incontinence. I will tell you something: millions of women give birth naturally. Millions of women do not have incontinence problems. Millions of women may have continence problems, because it is not about the bladder not doing its job, but about the conflict you hold inside that gives you a sense of lack of control in all aspects of your life. Because incontinence appears when you are very disappointed, very upset with life, which leads you to despair. Incontinence appears when you feel guilty that you cannot control situations in your life. And maybe, I think we all had moments when, with a sneeze, you felt you had to scream because you leak. Think about, at that time, what was your biggest challenge? Did you feel overwhelmed by everything that was happening? You wanted to draw attention to yourself, of course, unconsciously, because you needed love, to be accepted, seen, validated, and heard. It is normal to want these things and your body was just showing you that you need this control, so you can also control your bladder. When you want to delimit your own personal space, so that you become important again, you provoke such diagnoses that upset you.

And now what can you do to get rid of these thoughts and this state? Please, let go of rigid thinking and open the door to infinite possibilities of manifestation. So, trust that everything can manifest. Take responsibility for your actions so that you become your own master again. So you are your own master. No one can control this from outside. You build your life exactly as you want and allow your emotions to be free and express them easily. That is what you have to do. By the way, if there will be a moment when you feel you no longer have control over your bladder.

Another very common myth is that of any woman who has a terrible fear of hair loss during pregnancy or after birth. So I have all the variants. Let’s see a bit what hair symbolizes. Hair symbolizes power, your own and personal power, your inner strength, the connection between spirituality and body. That is why, in the past, women wore their hair long because it was clearly like an antenna, yes, um, with which they picked up, let’s say, foreign channels, which made the connection between above and below, between macro and micro, between spirituality and body. When you lose hair, it is clear that there is a very intense conflict in you that causes suffering or panic. The fear of losing contact with your intuition means hair loss. The fear of losing the connection with yourself while being in that role of mother makes your hair separate from you. It is an intense feeling of separation between spirit and body, which makes you want to pull your hair out. Yes, because you lose yourself. And this happens in most cases when a woman becomes a mother and is so preoccupied and busy with her baby that she loses herself somewhere along the way. And yes, I know, I have been there too and every time I lost myself, I had that, let’s say, separation conflict that manifested at the hair level. I lost my hair. So, when you find yourself in this equation of being a new mother, in a totally new situation you have never experienced and cannot imagine how it will be, please remember that it is not because of the child, not because of birth, yes?

And now another very important thing: the experience of birth can produce a profound separation from the body. Because when, let’s say, we have a birth with suffering, our body, in fact, our soul would want to detach from the body, so as not to experience so much pain. And then trauma makes our brain hemispheres, left and right, separate, just to cope and detach from the experience. It is a normal reaction of the psyche to survive strong shocks. So, when you lose yourself, when you separate from pain, from birth, from this exhausting period you will be in at some point after you give birth—and now I know you do not understand, but you will see that it is so—think that you need to find yourself in this whole equation so as not to separate from your hair, from our crowning glory. So hair does not fall out because of the child or deficiencies, but it is simply a major separation conflict.

And now another frequently asked question: can we dye our hair, yes or no? The problem with hair dyeing is the ammonia that enters the skin because it reaches the hair root. So, to dye your hair, maybe you can find a way to dye only the ends, not necessarily the roots, and then you can avoid that ammonia penetrating your system, because yes, it is not healthy. And anyway, it would be nice to find a natural alternative. And you are beautiful as you are. You do not necessarily have to do something to yourself, but if you feel the need, I am sure you will find a solution, whether it is an ammonia-free dye or you find ways to dye your hair without that ammonia entering your skin. Because, look, the skin is the largest absorption organ of the human body. Everything we put on the skin in seven seconds is in the bloodstream. So yes, be careful what you put on your skin, not only with dye, but also with creams, cosmetics, lipsticks, foundation, all those things.

And another basic rule. Everything you can eat is okay. Everything you cannot eat, do not even put on your skin. Good.

Another myth in pregnancy. What do we do with pets? Are they allowed to stay near the baby? Do we have to get rid of them? Do we have to give them away? What do we have to do with pets? My dear, this baby who chose you to be their mother chose you also because maybe you have a cat, or a dog, or a rabbit, or two parrots, or I don’t know what hamster or other animals. We have always lived with animals, and animals should not be thrown out of the house because the baby is coming. It is not fair to them, it is not right, and it is not necessary. Children can live very well with animals and become more compassionate, kinder, more humane. And it is normal to be so. If you do not have animals, it is not a problem. Do not get a pet now, but if there are already animals in your house, please just check that they are safe. That is, to avoid incidents. For example, cats that are not very visible and sometimes scratch with their paw or claw. If you have a cat that could scratch your child or could hit them. Or you have a fighting dog that might, I don’t know, get an idea, then yes, we need to review a bit how our family life with the baby will be. But if the cat is okay and does not hunt or attack or does not scratch if it moves, because children will move, they will not stay still, motionless, so the cat does not play or attack. So, as long as you have a normal pet, there is no reason to exile or give it away. It would even be nice and advisable to introduce it to the new family member, because you will see they will become the best guardians of your children.

And now a rather widespread myth in pregnancy, unfairly supported by many doctors in the medical world. I think they are misogynists or I do not understand why they would say such a thing, because there are very few cases where you should forbid a couple’s intimate interaction because she is expecting a baby. By the way, not only doctors have such fixations, although there is not necessarily a contraindication. Yes, I said very rarely there are contraindications when the baby is lost or when the woman must stay in bed or when the cervix is constantly open and she almost gives birth every time. So then, although it is not, it has not reached nine months yet. I want you to understand correctly, then maybe there is a reason to forbid it. But apart from religious aspects, because I have also heard dogmas like “oh my, when she is pregnant, the woman must not be touched.” Spare me, because even after birth, in some religions, the woman is seen as a great sinner because she brought a new life into the world. What are we talking about? So let’s leave dogmas aside and be normal, because no one is subjected or punished not to receive or not to have, because it is not normal.

First of all, your child comes on your sexual energy. You did not make a child with marbles or by correspondence. The child loves the energy of love with which they came. It is absolutely normal for the child to have no problem with the fact that you two love each other, touch each other, make love, because it is absolutely natural to be so. There are many who say that during pregnancy you are not allowed because, God knows, the child will receive something. These are absurdities. We are not animals. Let’s not forget that now the woman is more sensitive. Let’s not forget that now she is pregnant, but no one can forbid you to love your partner, even if she is pregnant. The woman needs such things right now, during pregnancy, because all kinds of fears appear, she devalues herself, who knows what guilt appears. It is normal for her to feel validated. And the man as well. We should not send him on vacation. Go alone now into the wilderness, because for nine months I am pregnant. Very well. You have no restriction. Love each other. It is absolutely normal.

Indeed, some say, although again it is not proven in practice, that until the eighth month, when the man ejaculates, sperm should not reach the woman’s cervix, because it could cause dilation. But some have tried to induce labor this way and did not succeed. So it is not necessarily a rule. But, let’s say that after eight months it would not be a problem even if these two entities, the cervix and sperm, meet. Because, look, it is not as they say, although sperm contains a prostaglandin that could soften the cervix and prepare it for birth, there is no clear evidence that when the man remained inside, the woman had contractions. So, you see, reality does not match what is said, with the myths.

So, my dear, please, before you receive such a vehement prohibition, which will cause you many emotional, psychological, affective problems, yes, please also consult the opinion of other doctors on the subject, because there are some who, I do not know what they think, that the man must reorganize himself, the woman must stay in a tower at the monastery. So these are things that are not natural, and what is natural is that if the child came on this energy of love and sexuality, it is normal for us to remain a couple and continue our life, because frustrations arise from such prohibitions, which have no medical value. So yes, please, before you apply, let’s say, such strange and very vehement rules, please...

Ask. So, no... I actually had students who were also forbidden by their gynecologist, probably someone frustrated. And they were both truly suffering. And, you know that saying, the more something is forbidden, the more you crave it. So, they were really suffering, they couldn’t take it anymore, they were even arguing, because the desire for closeness was so strong that they were desperate and couldn’t handle the situation they were in. So please, don’t fall for it and don’t listen. Don’t listen to all the rumors and nonsense you hear. Or, I don’t know, the dogmas someone tells you out of, I don’t know, some deep frustration, I suppose.

Another myth during pregnancy: we’re not allowed in the sun or seawater. Seriously? It’s actually recommended to go and enjoy the sun and the sea. We’re not worms, we’re not underground creatures. We need sunlight. If we didn’t live in a country with plenty of sun, we’d lack vitamin D. So, please, stop taking pills, because nothing can replace natural vitamin D, metabolized directly from sunlight. Go to the sea. Go in the sun. I recommend you spend as much time as possible in saltwater. Saltwater cleanses. Saltwater is healthy. Saltwater baths have existed since the beginning of time. There are births in saltwater. There are. If you want to go to the pool, think about how much chlorine you’re absorbing, because your skin absorbs it. But seawater, ocean water, is... We are made of plasma. Our plasma has a certain salinity. So, we are basically seawater. So, please, go to your natural environment, enjoy the sun, and yes, don’t overdo it. And yes, protect yourself. But please, no creams or other things you wouldn’t eat. We can protect ourselves with coconut oil or carrot oil or other natural oils that we can put on our skin. And yes, don’t expose yourself to the sun during peak hours and don’t go out in the sun all at once.

And by the way, another very important thing: avoid wearing sunglasses, because when you’re out, let’s say, tanning at the sea, when you get to the sea and want to tan and plan to spend three or four days at the beach, give up the sunglasses, because your retina, when you wear sunglasses, won’t understand that you’re now exposed to more sun and won’t trigger changes in your skin to prevent burning. When we wear sunglasses, (squeaking sound) our brain won’t block those receptors in our skin so we can tan nicely and evenly, and we’ll get burned. Why? Because our brain doesn’t know we’re exposed to the sun. When you go to the sea and want to sunbathe, don’t wear sunglasses and let your eyes transmit to your brain that now your skin can protect itself against, um, the more aggressive rays that could cause a burn. That doesn’t mean that if you go skiing you shouldn’t wear sunglasses, because indeed, you can get burned there when exposed to very strong light.

Another myth in pregnancy: supplements, yes or no? Well, my dear, you supplement with things you should actually get from food. Better review your diet and consult a nutritionist. I recommend not choosing one from our country, because here, nutrition is not quite what it should be. Eat what you like, but if you crave cola and burgers, that’s a perverted craving; instead, eat a varied diet. Eat colorful foods so you have every color and lots of green in your diet. So please, eat at least fifty percent raw, because that’s where we get our energy at the body level. Uh, drink enough water, yes, and until two or three in the afternoon eat as much fruit as you want. Don’t mix them with other foods. When you eat fruit, eat only fruit. Don’t eat fruit in the evening. Why? If you eat them in the evening, they’ll give you so much energy that you might not be able to sleep, because sucrose, the sugar in fruit, that healthy sugar, uh, takes six or seven hours to metabolize and will give you a lot of energy, and you might have insomnia because you’d actually need to do something else, as you still have a lot of sugar to burn in your body. So, in the morning, fruit on an empty stomach is perfect, water, uh, at lunch you can have salad, anything, and in the evening you can eat, I don’t know, not late, but in the evening or when you crave, something boiled, something warm, yes, it depends. Listen to your instincts, but not the perverted ones.

Then, myths in pregnancy about cosmetics, perfumes, creams—yes or no? I’ve already revealed the secret. If you can eat it, you can safely put it on your skin. See if you can eat your foundation, your lipstick, your cream. If they have natural ingredients, meaning they’re made by someone from natural ingredients, then yes, the cream probably won’t taste good, but the important thing is to remember the idea. When we put something on our skin, in seven seconds it’s in our body, in our bloodstream. So why not put something that can be metabolized? We don’t want to poison ourselves with the things we put on. So, especially during pregnancy, be careful with makeup, creams, foundations, perfumes. You really don’t need them. Anoint yourself with volatile oils, essential oils, uh, put on only what your body can digest.

Speaking of food, what can we do to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy? Stretch marks are those little white spots, women know them, which appear if we gain or lose weight suddenly. And if, now you’ll connect the emotional conflicts, I have a poor opinion of myself, I’m upset or at odds with my body, I’m afraid of others seeing me as I am, I don’t have the courage to let go with my partner, I’m afraid of being abandoned because I don’t look perfect, I’m afraid that when my belly grows, people will judge me, and I’m afraid that the “fashion look” in the project of looking good in other people’s eyes... What people say. I remember when I was young, I had these fears in my head and my thighs were full of stretch marks, even though I was skinny. So, when I made peace with myself and saw myself as beautiful in the mirror—and not just saw, but truly accepted and didn’t fool myself, I really believed and felt I was fine with myself—the stretch marks disappeared.

So, if you see this pregnancy as something that ruins your image, you’re afraid of gaining weight, or something happening to your body, at that moment, your body will manifest stretch marks. My dear, please, pregnancy makes a woman glow. Please shine. Please look at yourself and admire yourself in the mirror. Please do photo shoots, because they are the most beautiful and you’ll be able to enjoy those beautiful moments even after they pass, when you were pregnant and glowing. What you can do, for example, is use oil. I used olive oil with every pregnancy, in the evening before bed. I even asked my partner to massage my belly with oil. And I didn’t have stretch marks, but I also didn’t have feelings of devaluation during pregnancy, because I enjoyed myself. I felt I was much more beautiful than usual, I really was radiant. I felt radiant during pregnancy.

If you still have fears and think something will happen to your body, repeat these phrases every day: I accept becoming creative and finding validation in myself, not in others. I stop poisoning and punishing myself. This poisoning also comes from emotions, yes? I realize that other people’s opinions don’t matter for my inner state, which is nice to say, sometimes hard to apply. I take my life into my own hands and no longer let others decide for me. I no longer listen to all the women who want to give me advice about pregnancy. Be careful, yes? I make peace with myself and learn to love myself. Give your body a break. I recognize my value and allow energy to flow freely through my body. So, take a picture of yourself, repeat the affirmations because they will help you.

If you’re afraid of gaining weight during pregnancy, know that the fat layer you’ve accumulated or are accumulating now, in excess, is actually a defense mechanism against outside attacks. Attacks don’t mean someone comes at you with a knife or gun. Attack means energetic attack, verbal attack, visual attack. It’s how you perceive whether others support you or not. So ask yourself, what void are you trying to fill when you stuff your stomach? What does compulsive eating compensate for? Maybe you’re hungry for love or tenderness? Have you lost your pleasure and enthusiasm for life? Or think about who hurt your heart as a child, because that’s where you’ll find the answers, and ask yourself who you’re protecting yourself from and accumulating fat to (sound of something falling) make it easier to get over other people’s words.

And now, another very important thing: that fear of excessive weight gain during pregnancy. This fear is quite harmful. Why? Because it might cause the baby to come earlier. There is a very high chance of prematurity. If a woman constantly transmits to her baby that she doesn’t want to gain weight, that she’s afraid of deforming, of something happening, the baby constantly receives this message from the mother and will decide: “Okay, mom, I’ll come earlier so I don’t grow too much and give you too big a belly, so you can get rid of this fear of gaining weight.” And I want to say that this applies. All the women who attended my courses and whom I followed during pregnancy gave birth prematurely because they had that fear they couldn’t manage, of not gaining weight.

My dear, if you feel alone, abandoned, rejected by others, if you no longer want to live with frustration and insecurity and compensate with food, if you want to protect yourself at any cost from external emotional aggression, if you miss love but at the same time avoid it, if you feel a great lack of affection in your life, if you feel invisible, unseen, or if you want to appear strong or want to possess more things because in your mind possession has been confused with the feeling of being someone, please, work through these emotions and conflicts you have, because they might generate a premature birth, which, believe me, neither you nor your child want, because the best and most effective incubator on this planet is not an electronic one. It’s your womb, your belly. So don’t force your baby, through your thoughts, to come earlier because you’re afraid of gaining weight. So, repeat to yourself that you take your needs into account without caring about others’ opinions and that you trust life and everything it brings you. Trust yourself and enjoy life.

Good. There are still many women, especially now with these trendy illnesses, who, when they get a fever, panic terribly and do anything to lower it. First of all, I want you to know that fever is not something to be afraid of. It’s just your body’s way of sending you a message. What’s the message? Your emotions are burning you inside, turning into anger. So you’re angry when you have a fever or you got angry about a situation, and that’s why your body developed a fever. If you feel trapped in an uncomfortable situation with no way out, you can also develop a fever. Clearly, something is irritating you inside, in your life, and making you boil. You’re boiling with anger, boiling with rage. Yes, that means your temperature has risen because something is really bothering you. So, to calm the fever, you need to resolve the conflict. You need to find out what the reason and conflict that caused the fever are, and the fever might disappear as quickly as it came, because you can express your anger, frustration, or irritation through a constructive dialogue. Say what you need to say. OK, if you can’t say it, write it down, record it, do something, take an action to release that boiling inside you and calm down.

And another thing, and this is very important for you to learn and later when you have a child, because there will be times when your child will take on your conflicts and manifest your fever and anger. Please, read about fever so you won’t be scared anymore, because up to 102°F (39°C), when you have a fever, you don’t have to do anything. Maybe some vinegar socks, some warm towels you put on your body to cool down. But you don’t need to take antipyretics. Antipyretics block the fever’s manifestation. And I recommend, please, read Dr. Mendelsohn’s book, “How to Raise a Child in Spite of Your Doctor?” It’s an extraordinary book. Robert Mendelsohn was a doctor, actually he’s no longer alive. And, um, he clearly says that with fever, leave it alone, don’t do anything. Maybe vinegar socks, half vinegar, half water. But don’t interfere. Don’t suppress the fever, because then it can’t do its job. There’s a lot to read in the Dictionary of Diseases, you can find information about fever. And you’ll calm down, because what really gets to us psychologically are things we don’t know how to handle. So you need information so that when you’re in that situation, you know how to manage it.

After that, many women say: “Oh no, just don’t let me catch a cold!” Well, and if you do, what will you do? You know that a cold goes away in seven days untreated or in a week if treated. So what does it matter? What does the cold want to tell you? The symptoms of a cold give you a reason to be alone with yourself and your thoughts. You have too much on your mind and need a break because you feel threatened. You feel tense and uptight and need a break from pleasing everyone. You don’t have to please anyone. That’s why you take that break and snuggle at home. You catch a cold because you lack love, because something in you has gone cold. If you just sit and think about these things, you’ll see that your next cold will pass differently than before. And without medication. So, what can you repeat? Take a picture of yourself. I allow myself to be well, to be myself, without judging myself. I am increasingly flexible with myself and with situations in my life, and I see how others reflect me and learn to consider myself. So the cold says: I want a break. Give yourself that break and honor yourself, because the more you trample yourself and say no, I can’t, I don’t have time, the harder it will be, because your body will find other ways to put you in bed.

There are also many women who have that fear of childbirth. Why? Because they’ve heard too many stories from their mother or other women, or from movies or friends. There’s a big fear of the unknown, because, look, why is the topic of childbirth such a big unknown? Because we don’t learn about it in school. No one in this life teaches you about childbirth. No school, not even in medical school, in obstetrics, do they teach anything about birth. They only teach about procedures and things to speed up something that should be as physiological as breathing. So, what causes these fears? I mentioned stories, then the fear of the unknown, which can be resolved how? Well, through this birth course, you’ll learn the natural stages of your body during birth, and then you won’t have that fear, because ninety-nine percent of fear comes from what we don’t know. Once you learn about things, you have no reason to be afraid, and you’ll see that much of your fear will subside after you finish this course, which actually teaches you what it’s all about.

Then, the third source of fear is unconscious memories from your own birth. Here, yes, I recommend you take the live online course with me on healing your own birth, because you’ll see how much this experience influences your entire life, not just your child’s birth. What can you do? Replace fear with trust in your spirit and soul, which chose this experience, so you can handle it, otherwise you wouldn’t have chosen it. And be careful with those fears, which can be quite big, because the bigger they are, the more likely they are to come true. I actually get a lot of testimonials from mothers who say: “What I feared most during birth, that’s what happened.” See? The bigger and more unresolved the fear, the more likely you are to experience exactly that. Because we materialize: where our thoughts are, there our energy is, and where our energy is, that’s where things materialize.

So, about the fear of premature birth, what does premature mean? Up to about thirty-seven weeks, the baby is considered premature. The fear of premature birth, as I said, is often caused by the fear of gaining weight, so the baby decides to come earlier, or if there’s a secret related to that birth. Many women who hide their pregnancy have premature births. Why? Because they actually wish they weren’t pregnant, and the baby receives that message and comes earlier so the mother’s belly won’t show. My dear, no matter what form or shade your fear takes, I want you to feel prepared and mature enough to bring this child into the world at the right time. That’s about the fear of prematurity.

If there’s that fear of prematurity, somehow at an unconscious level, there’s something there that rejects your baby. Because somewhere in your childhood, you as a child were rejected by others, just like now, when you unconsciously reject this child, you’re afraid of the responsibility of raising this child. Unconsciously, you want to get rid of all this fuss with birth and everything else as quickly as possible. There’s also a fear of judgment and what others will say, because it seems that other people’s opinions still matter to you. And yes, this fear of prematurity definitely comes from many secrets. Transgenerational. It would be great and extraordinary if you could talk a bit with your mother, grandmother, or someone who knows what happened there, because it clearly has connotations related to feelings of shame, guilt, things that have been passed down. So, all the fears that come up during pregnancy, please, write them down somewhere and investigate and think about where they came from, where they started, what is the root? Because when you ask yourself these questions, you’re on the path to healing, because your body has brought them to the surface, you’ve seen them, you’ve validated them, they’re there, but you haven’t swept them under the rug. And once you’ve validated them, it’s clear that... they’re no longer your enemy, but now you see them differently and can explore them, and life will help you find the best ways to heal these fears.

Now, a very common issue for ninety-five percent of mothers is the fear of pain during childbirth. Ninety-five percent of this fear comes from not knowing the physiological process of birth. Exactly what I was saying earlier. When birth is not disturbed, it can be an intense and beautiful experience. The fear of pain is related to how much pain you’ve stored as a child, in yourself and your body. And it doesn’t have to be physical pain. It can be tremendous emotional pain. Pain during birth is associated with your own beliefs about birth. If you’ve listened all your life only to stories about how terrible birth was, of course you’ll create a similar story. Pain is closely linked to the fear of dying or losing the baby. See if someone in your family lost a child? When did that affect you? It’s related to wanted or unwanted abortions or the loss of other children, and it’s related to the fact that you almost died at some point in this life. Some associations were made there.

Good. If the baby in your womb fills a void in your heart, birth will be a confrontation with the loss of that feeling of fullness you had during pregnancy. It often happens that a woman who became pregnant, thus filling a great void, has a difficult birth because she doesn’t want to let go of that void, she doesn’t want to—she wants to keep it. Yes? And this is a very subtle thing. Ask yourself if this child filled a very big void, and if you know that’s the case, be careful how you prepare for birth, because you might need to prepare for a slightly more challenging birth. If birth is associated with separation from the child, then it can be very physically painful, because your mind associates it with a loss, and loss for you means a lack of control. That’s why preparation for birth is so important.

Most women say: Well, millions of women have given birth. Yes, I know. But how did they give birth? That would be the question. How easy was it? How hard was it? What was the predominant emotion at birth? So, there are many aspects to discuss, but you’re on the right track. Take a picture of this slide so you can further explore these fears, yes? And write to me. And I’m sure you’ll get good advice.

There are also women who have had miscarriages, and I had two or three miscarriages before my first child was born. And I want you to think a bit about the following questions: Who wants this child? You or your partner? Or relatives? Or society? Or now that you’re married, when are you having a child? You know those lines. Are you afraid you won’t be a good mother? Maybe it’s not the right time for a child in your life? What void does the child fill in your heart? Do you have a fear? As if you’re always walking on quicksand? Is this child now too much for you? Do you feel some aggression towards men in general? There are many very deep questions. I know I may be asking too many questions at once, but please take a picture of this slide so you can explore all these answers. So, there’s an unconscious fear in you that this child might change your life, your relationship dynamics, and that’s very important, your career, your habits, and your freedom. So, when we talk about this, yes, it’s quite difficult. Because, you see, there are many barriers there, in the subconscious, even if consciously, we’ve never asked ourselves these questions. But it’s important to ask them.

And of course, there’s the fear of having children. There are women who don’t want this and still get pregnant and think: “Oh no, but why do I have this fear of having children?” Here, the answer is only related to your childhood and what was transmitted transgenerationally from mother to daughter or from father to son in your family tree. So, you need to find where this fear of being able to have a child, to raise a child, to know what to do with a child comes from. See where this fear repeats itself. And one more very important thing. To know how things stand and to realize what your doctor’s view of pregnancy is, pay attention to their words. Watch how they speak, how they talk to you. Listen to the words they use. Because there are two types of language. There are words that condemn and words that calm.

For example, if you ever hear your doctor at an ultrasound or routine checkup telling you that your baby has growth retardation, please change your doctor, because no doctor would use such words unless they want to manipulate you into doing what they want. A responsible doctor who doesn’t want to manipulate you, when they see that the embryo or fetus isn’t at a certain stage, will tell you very nicely and elegantly: “Look, the baby doesn’t yet have the average calculated weight.” A doctor who tells you your placenta is aged is a doctor you should change, because they’re trying to manipulate you with those words, instead of telling you your placenta is fine and has reached a natural level of maturity, depending on which trimester you’re in.

So, my dear, change the doctor who tells you your cervix is long and wiry, instead of saying: “Relax, my dear, your cervix will dilate exactly when you relax and when you give birth.” A doctor who tells you dilation blockage will never tell you it’s just an emotional hurdle and that you should relax to get past it. A doctor or woman who tells you you don’t have milk, whether she’s a nurse or doctor, is someone who will never support breastfeeding. Because those are words meant to manipulate you toward a bottle of formula. How could they speak? Very nicely. Lactation needs to be stimulated. That’s all. Otherwise, it comes and is established.

A doctor who threatens you at every ultrasound that you have a baby that’s too big, meaning a macrosomic baby, clearly needs to be changed because they’ll only deliver by C-section, while a doctor who says: “Relax, my dear, your baby will adapt to your pelvis.” That’s an honest doctor I wish for you at birth. Those who say you can’t give birth naturally, and that’s the first thing they say when they see you—absolutely not. Women are built to give birth. Change them, because that person won’t support you.

When you hear the probable due date, again, it’s a threat: if you don’t give birth on that day, I’ll cut you. That’s not what you need; rather, you should be told that the baby will come when ready, because they don’t expire. Yes. If you hear that our maternity saves you from birth or that here you give birth without pain, please, investigate further how exactly? Because the physiological process shouldn’t be operated on, and the baby is not a fetus extracted from a uterus.

Yes, my dear, these were the myths in pregnancy. Thank you for watching this video until the end. See you at the next lesson.
