Now that I have covered the maternity bag, let’s see what the next clear sign that birth is approaching might be. Pain in the lumbar area. That is, here, in the kidney area, the back, the coccyx, the pubic area, right at the pubic bone, at the mons pubis. Or cramps similar to menstrual cramps. For those women who have experienced menstrual pain on the first or second day, or in the first days, you know what cycle cramps feel like. I’m not saying these cramps are normal, but I am saying they are very similar to contractions, because they feel and are experienced just like contractions. When you start feeling pain in the lumbar area, the pubic area, cramps in this lower region, it is a sign that labor is starting. I believe eighty percent of women go through such moments, and what I can tell you is that there is a breathing technique I teach in my course, where you will find the two types of breathing for labor. I recommend them, because they greatly alleviate the pain sensations, even if, let’s say, you have experienced menstrual pain and have somehow trained yourself in this regard. I also recommend the pain oil, because this oil will ease your pain sensation without suppressing it and without, let’s say, masking the symptoms or stopping the process, because contractions continue even if you apply that pain oil on yourself... It’s not like a medication. For example, No-Spa. Yes, No-Spa, which is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy, and I talk about this in the birth plan. No-Spa is not okay to take during pregnancy; it is an antispasmodic, while contractions are uterine spasms. So, in the end, what do we do? Do we stop labor, or what should we do? And by the way, I know there are doctors who recommend using No-Spa, at least in Romania this medication is very popular. I do not agree with this, because there are many other natural, simple ways to stop some contractions, let’s say premature ones, or Braxton-Hicks contractions, or, let’s say, false contractions, although none are really false, all are real, but women get scared if their belly hardens and don’t think it’s due to stress, but rather that the belly is doing whatever it wants. No, the belly is just signaling that there is too much stress for you and you should reduce it. But if we don’t know how to read our bodies, we end up taking pills. So yes, I only recommend what is okay and what does not suppress symptoms or the physical manifestation in the body.

Good. The fourth clear sign that labor is starting is the fissuring or rupture of the membranes. I was glad to find a photo where a woman’s water broke—she was wearing jeans, and you could see what it means for your water to break. So, the fissuring or rupture of the membranes can happen right at the beginning, or not, during labor, or not, or even during expulsion, or not. And if it doesn’t, then the baby will be born with the membranes intact. In a course about membranes, I will tell you about—and show you what a baby born in intact membranes looks like. And it is often possible, if doctors do not intervene; there are many women who give birth to their babies with the membranes intact. That is, the baby is born in the amniotic sac. How beautiful!

Now, we have two notions: fissuring or rupture of the membranes. That is, when your water breaks or when your water fissures. When it fissures, not all the fluid comes out at once. When it ruptures, it all comes out at once. Simple. How do you know all the fluid has come out? Well, you’ll find your jeans soaked down to your feet. If it fissures, with each contraction, another jet of water comes out. It’s pretty simple. And now, here you have a gorgeous photo of a gynecologist assisting at a birth, where the baby’s membranes rupture right during expulsion and the amniotic fluid gushes out. Guess who it goes on? Directly on the doctor. The membranes can rupture at any time during labor. Here, the membranes rupture during expulsion. I found this photo very beautiful and conclusive so you can understand how the water can break for a woman, and that water is odorless, colorless, so there’s no reason to panic, “Oh my, what’s happening!” Now, I’ll show you some images of a natural water birth with the amniotic sac intact. Here you see the baby in the amniotic sac, and here you can see how, with its hands and with the help of an adult, the baby frees itself from its amniotic sac, which is a very fine membrane. And this is a water birth. And regarding the question I hear most often: “What happens when you give birth in water, when will the baby breathe?” Well, the baby will breathe only when its mouth or nose touches air for the first time. So, very simply, the baby opens the membranes after birth, if it is born in the amniotic sac, or it needs help. Here you also see a nuchal cord like a scarf, where the cord is wrapped around the neck once, like a scarf. That’s why it’s called that.

Now, to help you understand a bit, although there is a separate, much more comprehensive and explanatory course, what is the amniotic sac and the chorionic sac? Here you see only the amniotic and chorionic sacs in the same place. But both these sacs are very thin, and the membranes rupture or fissure because the baby releases a hormone that thins them. When I hear some doctors claim, “Oh, the amniotic sac ruptured because the baby had long nails.” I can’t help but smile, because it’s such a childish and embarrassing thing to say as a doctor, right? Because the baby does not start scratching the amniotic sac and has no pleasure in doing so during pregnancy, just as, for example, even if you see, look, the placenta is right next to the baby. The baby will never hit the placenta, but will kick all parts of your belly, when you actually see little hands and feet poking out, right? When it’s boxing night, for example. But the baby does not do this instinctively, and the membranes only rupture when the baby releases a hormone that thins the membranes, both the chorionic and amniotic sacs, and these fissure or rupture, that is, they break. This is what the membrane looks like. This is what the amniotic and chorionic sacs look like. The two membranes are here together. Yes, they are that fine, and they contain the baby for nine months. It’s interesting how perfect nature is and how much is created without us knowing or doing anything in particular.

Now, okay, the membranes have ruptured—membranes, not membrane, because there are two: the amniotic and chorionic sacs. Anyway, it doesn’t matter, but just so you know and for your general knowledge, how much time you have until contractions start. So, for contractions to start, right? I’m not talking about the baby being born, just about contractions starting. And I’m speaking plainly so you understand that after the membranes rupture, you don’t have just one hour for contractions to start or to give birth, but you have twenty-four hours from the rupture or fissuring of the membranes for contractions to start, meaning the contractions that will help you deliver or birth the baby. So, your membranes can rupture tonight at eight o’clock, and you can even go without contractions—though they will appear at some point—until tomorrow night at eight. That means twenty-four hours. This information is so you don’t go to the hospital too early, because at the hospital, if you don’t have contractions, they will induce them. With what? With artificial oxytocin, labor augmentation, induction, and other things, because these are standard procedures. So, it’s clear: after the membranes rupture or fissure, you have twenty-four hours for contractions to start. These twenty-four hours are accepted by the World Health Organization, after which, of course, as a medical precaution, you will be given antibiotics against a possible infection. In some countries, you can request not to be given antibiotics unless, let’s say, you develop a fever. If a fever appears, then yes, we have an indication that there might be a risk of infection. Many mothers refuse this antibiotic because... It is given preventively. And I am not a fan of prevention just for the sake of it. I would only do it if something really out of the ordinary appeared.

What do you do in these twenty-four hours until contractions appear? Well, you wait! Be patient and relax. In no case should you continue doing the things you were doing up until now; simply put everything on pause, because the world will function without you for the next twenty-four hours, and what you have prepared so far is well prepared. It no longer matters what someone else wants. From now on, what matters is that you and the baby are well. Don’t waste your energy on other things, in other places, or on other actions, because you will really need this energy for labor. So, after the membranes rupture, relax. If you happen to be in a city where you cannot give birth and want to go to another city because that’s where you have chosen your maternity hospital and everyone is waiting for you with your birth plan, a gentle birth, and the magic hour, then, when the membranes rupture, it is clear that you need to leave, get in the car, and go there. The important thing is that the trip should not be longer than four or five hours. Yes, about that. But here you need to decide for yourself. Maybe you’d rather already be in the city where you will give birth from week thirty-eight, or you take a sort of mini-vacation, or you only go when the first signs appear? Probably women who are already on their second, third, or fifth child no longer think about staying two or three weeks before birth in another city, but go at the first sign. But again, this depends a lot on how you are and how safe you feel.

Good. After these twenty-four hours from the rupture or fissuring of the membranes pass, I want to tell you that you still have forty-eight hours to give birth to your baby. So, wow, how much time! Many of us do not know this information and allow ourselves to be panicked and influenced by medical staff who say that if you haven’t given birth in six hours, you must have a C-section. This is not true. Theoretically, from the rupture of the membranes, a woman has seventy-two hours, that is, twenty-four hours plus forty-eight. Yes, so we have seventy-two hours available, meaning three days and three nights for the baby to come. As long as everything is okay, meaning as long as the baby has regular heartbeats and the mother feels well. Yes, so we are not talking about atypical cases, but about a normal, low-risk birth. After the membranes rupture, you have forty-eight hours to give birth, and according to international regulations from the World Health Organization, even fifteen years ago, the maximum time allowed for a birth was seventy-two hours from the rupture of the membranes. Only in Romania, most hospitals barely accept twelve hours, and even that is a lot. Sometimes you barely get six or five hours. So, theoretically, seventy-two hours was the standard even fifteen years ago. And it wasn’t done poorly. Now we are returning to procedures that used to be normal. And now, because everything is fast, fast, fast, we rush a lot. So, according to the WHO, we have only forty-eight hours, but fifteen years ago, seventy-two hours were allowed. I have often worked with mothers who needed three days and three nights to give birth, because they went through various blockages, of course emotional, or unresolved issues from pregnancy, or unresolved conscious memories from their own birth. How did their mother experience birth with that mother? Yes, so there are many things to consider at birth.

Now, how do you know your water has broken? Well, you know because the membranes rupture and leave marks on your clothes, and they rupture when the baby decides. Remember the hormone that is released and that fissures and thins the membranes. It will feel as if someone poured a bucket of warm water on you. Warm water, because the amniotic fluid will always be at ninety-eight degrees Fahrenheit. And when? Just like when you pee, and pee is warm, and the fluid in your body is warm. Because that’s how it is. For example, the baby stays for nine months at ninety-eight degrees. It’s like an ultra all-inclusive, like in Tenerife, the same temperature all the time. The membranes are fissured if a little fluid leaks with each contraction, but nothing to worry about. It will still be a while before the baby is born. Very few births are those lightning-fast ones, where after the membranes rupture, everything speeds up and the baby comes quickly. Yes, there’s little chance of that happening, but yes, we can consider it. But when you know what to expect and how your body works, you shouldn’t panic or do anything special, but simply witness the birth, be there, support your baby, and support your body. It’s very simple.

Now, what is the normal color of amniotic fluid? And now you look at this picture and ask, what is that? Well, I chose a picture to illustrate what color amniotic fluid should be, and this picture is not amniotic fluid, but rice in water. You know when you wash rice and the water becomes cloudy, whitish? That’s rice, right? Well, amniotic fluid does not have rice in it. Amniotic fluid only has the color of the water in which rice is washed. Yes, the first water in which rice is washed. That’s why this picture with rice. So, the normal color of amniotic fluid is a translucent white. The fluid is emollient, meaning it is slightly oily, odorless, colorless, and has a milky appearance. Just as you see in this picture with rice being washed in water.

Good. This is what a pad with normal amniotic fluid looks like, and this is what a pad with colored amniotic fluid looks like. Colored, meaning greenish, brownish. What does this mean? When the color of the amniotic fluid changes and becomes green or brown or acquires an acidic and unpleasant smell, acidic, as if the smell stings your nose. That’s what amniotic fluid smells like when the baby has passed meconium. I have a special course where I explain what meconium is. I won’t go into too much detail now, but you have a lot to learn from the other courses, because yes, the subject is vast. So, meconium in the amniotic fluid requires the baby to be monitored, in case it has entered fetal distress. What does fetal distress mean? Now I want to ask you to take a picture, so you remember this, and note that fetal distress means when the heart rate is below eighty or above one hundred seventy for more than one minute. So, if we monitor a baby and monitor the heartbeat, then the heart rate must be below eighty if it is in fetal stress, or above one hundred seventy, again, if it is in fetal distress. And then there is no time, then we no longer give birth naturally. Then we perform an emergency C-section, because we must save the baby’s life. When the baby enters fetal distress, the heartbeat slows down or speeds up, usually slows down, but there is also the other side, with hypertension. So, the normal range for a baby’s heartbeat is between one hundred and one hundred forty-five. That is, one hundred, no, one hundred thirty, one hundred forty-five. So, when it is below eighty and above one hundred seventy—not at the same time, but either below eighty or above one hundred seventy—remember this: that means fetal stress. And why do I say more than one minute? Because you might be misled—it happens, and I have witnessed such cases—because during a contraction, the baby’s heart rate drops. And then some doctors who want to finish the birth quickly will say, “Oh no, there’s fetal stress, let’s operate and get the baby out,” and then the woman no longer has a chance to give birth naturally, even though she is almost in expulsion or is in expulsion. What does this mean? Well, during a contraction, the fetal heart rate drops. That is, the baby’s heartbeat in the womb or in the vaginal canal drops. Why? Because during the contraction, the baby is squeezed and pushed forward and exerts effort, and then the heart rate changes. But after the contraction passes, the heart rate returns to normal. That is, between one hundred thirty-five, one hundred forty-five, one hundred fifty-five, or one hundred sixty-five is possible. So here you need to see what the normal heartbeat is. But usually, all women go to an ultrasound full of emotions, agitated and nervous, and then you can’t tell if those are the normal heartbeats, because the baby picks up on the mother’s stress, and of course, its heart rate increases.

Good. About meconium. Not in this course, but in the course about meconium, and I have a separate one. So, go there to know exactly the situations where an emergency C-section is really needed. I return to another clear sign that labor is starting. Until now, it was about amniotic fluid: when the water breaks, how it breaks, what should happen. Another clear sign that labor is starting is the onset of uterine contractions that will bring your baby into the world. What you see here is a cross-section of a belly, and this upside-down pear with this little tail is actually the uterus, and this tail part is the vagina. What you see here is the bladder, the colon, and the baby is inside, with its head down and legs up. You see there are some longitudinal muscles, and again I recommend you go through the contractions course, because there I explain exactly what a contraction is, how it manifests, how long it lasts, how the uterus works, and so on. And here you see the same uterus, but you see different muscles, the circular muscles, which have a different role in uterine tone.

So, let’s say the fifth very clear sign that labor is starting is that you feel uterine contractions. How do you feel them? Well, your belly hardens. For about thirty-five seconds, which at first repeat irregularly, even once every twenty minutes, and after a while, they repeat more and more often, up to intervals of five or six minutes. So, at first you will have a contraction and a twenty-minute break. Those early contractions might last only twenty seconds. They get longer as labor progresses. They intensify as labor progresses. So, you will feel uterine contractions and you will feel your belly harden. You will simply know that these are the contractions that confirm labor has started.

Now, what do uterine contractions do? I’ll give you a brief course, because the full course is in another video. These contractions propel and push the baby millimeter by millimeter into this world. So, what you see in the first image is a baby still in the amniotic sac, and the cervix here is closed. This is the exit to the vagina. This is the cervix. Here is the mucus plug, and during labor, this cervix opens and allows the baby to pass and slide into the pelvis. Do you see these pelvic bones? You can already see the baby’s head has entered the vagina. Because the vagina is very wrinkled, it stretches and allows the baby to pass through the vagina. So, that’s what the contraction actually does: it pushes the baby millimeter by millimeter into the vagina and out.

Let’s see what to do when contractions start. If they start at night, please try to sleep. That is, if you are already in the city where you will give birth. If contractions start and you still have one hundred eighty miles to get to the maternity hospital, you should leave, because you won’t have time to wait. That’s why you need to organize yourself well now that you know the physiology. So, you are in the city where you need to give birth. Try to sleep. If you sleep, it means there is still enough time to get to the hospital when you wake up from stronger contractions. I have an example of a mother who told me that the night before birth, she felt like she had some contractions, but managed to sleep, and in the morning around six, when she woke up, she simply wanted to go to the bathroom, because that is a habit of any pregnant woman. The closer you get to birth, the more often you go to the bathroom, because the baby presses on the bladder. She got up and felt the baby had descended and said, “Let’s go to the hospital!” and she got to the hospital in ten minutes and in half an hour was holding her baby in her arms, because all night while she slept or dozed, the contractions produced dilation and prepared the cervix and vagina for birth. So yes, it can happen even in your sleep. It can be beautiful, it can be smooth, as long as the woman is relaxed and knows what to do.

Let’s see what a belly looks like during a contraction. It is tense, the belly is visibly more prominent, and you will see that when you have a contraction, if you put your hand on your belly, it is hard, it tightens, and you will feel this with your hand, because you feel it in your body, in your belly. From that moment, I want you to stop any activity you were doing that has nothing to do with birth. And I want you to focus on your breathing and relax, because this is the most important thing—to focus on your contractions, because they are not in vain. But if you occupy your mind with something else, those contractions will consume all your surplus energy that should be allocated to birth, and you’ll find that the contractions go to waste, nothing happens because you are not present, and labor is greatly prolonged. So, isn’t it better to stop everything and focus only on birth? Especially since you know it will be a fantastic energy expenditure? Of course, yes. That’s why I say, from the moment you start having contractions, please stop any other activity and focus on your breathing, on the dilation contractions—there is a special course for dilation contractions—and on your relaxation, because relaxation is everything, and this way you help the contractions be as effective as possible.
