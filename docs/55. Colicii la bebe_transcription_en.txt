Hello, my dear! I want to talk to you today about colic in babies, because this is a very controversial topic, especially since the idea that “all babies will have colic” has spread, and this is what mothers fear most. That’s why they think: “Oh no, how many things do I need to buy to relieve my baby’s colic!” I want to explain to you now, in detail, what colic actually means, why the baby’s tummy hurts, how these colic episodes manifest, and why, most of the time, these colic episodes, in fact, don’t even exist. The child cries for many other reasons. Let’s see how we can organize ourselves during the postpartum period. Let’s also look at how long breastfeeding lasts, because many babies cry simply because the mother loses patience and thinks that breastfeeding is done in ten minutes. What is the secret to a calm baby? I will teach you some distinct signs for “I’m hungry!” and show you the clear signs for “I’m full!” You’ll see that you can figure out why your baby is crying. We’ll talk about the myth of colic in babies. I’ll also tell you when to alternate breasts and about growth spurts—yes, growth spurts, another thing that scares women. Welcome to the course on breastfeeding and colic in babies!

My dear, after birth, I want to ask you to prepare for two months in pajamas, because you won’t be doing anything else. You’ll sleep when the baby sleeps, you’ll have food served in bed, and please, leave the housework to someone else, because if you don’t, you’ll truly have a very hard time. Know that these two months in pajamas are like two months of honeymoon with your baby. Yes, I know, maybe you didn’t have a two-month honeymoon with the baby’s father, but with your baby, this will be your honeymoon and it can be very beautiful if you know how to manage it.

Now, let’s see how long breastfeeding lasts, because what most women don’t know is that in the first weeks of life, breastfeeding is non-stop, because the baby falls asleep on you and wakes up on you, always at the breast. Another thing women don’t know—there are all sorts of coaching courses about how the baby should sleep, how much the baby should sleep, things that not only traumatize the child but also drive the mother crazy, because her maternal instincts tell her: “Hold your baby” and comfort their crying, screams, needs. Because that’s normal. Those training methods for babies don’t work because they cause lifelong trauma. So remember, my dear, babies cannot be trained and you can’t impose a schedule without causing lifelong trauma. There have been women who tried this sleep and wake training with their babies, tried for two or three months, and then realized how traumatized their child became and how much they regretted it.

So don’t try it, because I’m telling you from experience, it’s not what you want, and the key word for you as a mother is to organize yourself so you have nothing else to do. I know it’s hard to understand now, if you don’t have a child, that… you can’t give up your things, your job, the things you used to do, but you have nothing else to do, because breastfeeding in the first two months will be non-stop. If you don’t accept this and take on work at home or do other things, you’ll tire yourself out and exhaust yourself for nothing. And yes, at the expense of your nerves.

What is a content baby? Does such a thing exist? Yes, my dear, there are babies who don’t cry. What’s their secret? The mother’s constant presence. It’s very simple: if you are present with your baby all the time, your child will be content and won’t cry. Because crying is the only way they show you they have unmet needs. So, plan to stay with your baby non-stop for the first four to six weeks after birth. Sleep with your baby, without separate beds, without separate rooms. This separate room thing, the baby’s crib—nonsense, it doesn’t exist. Stay with your baby, be with your baby.

After two months, limit yourself to activities where you’re still in their visual field, so they’re not afraid you’ll leave or disappear, like what happened in the hospital when they were terrified they’d never see you again. What does it mean to be in your baby’s visual field? Your baby’s visual field is this. They don’t see to the side like we do. They see straight ahead. If you’re not somewhere in front, or if they’re in a stroller turned away from you, they’ll think you don’t exist anymore, that you’ve left, or someone took you, or they’ve been snatched from your arms again. That’s when babies cry. That’s why you’ll often see babies screaming when they’re pushed in a stroller facing away from the mother and can’t see her.

So, my dear, if you want a content baby, stay with them non-stop, because they can’t process that separation from you after birth except by being traumatized. They really need you non-stop. So don’t plan to do things, don’t plan to leave, don’t plan for someone else to replace you, because it’s impossible. Even if they stay with dad—it’s good, but you’ll still be the main one. So, stay with your baby non-stop, sleep with them in your bed. Don’t traumatize them, don’t separate them from you, don’t set those boundaries.

Now, how do you know they’re hungry? Well, we have the first image here. Let’s say the baby is still sleeping when they start to get hungry. They’ll turn their head to one side and then the other, because they’re searching. When the baby starts moving their head from left to right, it’s clear they’re looking for their mother. When they start opening their mouth as they turn, it’s clear they’re looking for the breast. If they don’t find anything, they might start smacking their lips, making… (smacking sound), right? They won’t stop searching. They’ll stretch up, to the side, smack their lips, grunt, start grumbling. Because the baby doesn’t cry at first. They go through a stage where they signal.

If the baby is in another room, we miss these signals and only find the baby already frustrated after they’ve sent the signals and no one came, because no one heard them. They start putting their fingers and fists in their mouth, just like you see in this image, I’m showing you with the mouse. Then they keep smacking their lips, putting their hands in their mouth, and then the crying starts. So, how do you know they’re hungry? Very simple. As soon as they start searching, you need to be there. That’s why sleeping with your baby is the simplest way to feed your child without stressing or overwhelming them.

How do you know they’re full? Well, my dear, the baby is full when they detach from the breast and keep sleeping without starting to cry. If they detach from the breast because they fell asleep and immediately start crying or fussing, it’s clear they didn’t eat enough. If they don’t cry after letting go of the breast, then there’s no problem. It’s perfect. They’ve fed, they’re sleeping. Ninety-nine percent of babies fall asleep at the breast. Actually, one hundred percent. If your baby lets go of the breast, it means they’re full. If you let go of the breast and want to put them down, don’t bother, because you’ll be your baby’s living pacifier. And yes, in the first three or four weeks, you’ll have unwashed hair, maybe you brushed your teeth two or three days ago. You’ll go to the bathroom with your baby, but believe me, you’ll be head over heels in love, because your baby will steal your heart. That’s what they do.

So, my dear, it’s very simple. If they let go of the breast and keep sleeping, it means you’re sleeping together, because that’s how you’ll sleep—skin to skin, in your arms, on your chest, on your belly, on your chest, it doesn’t matter. The important thing is not to plan to do anything while the baby sleeps. You’ll be so exhausted that you’ll want to sleep too. That’s why, if you want help, call for help with the household chores you can’t do anymore, because you’ll be sleeping with your baby. Because you need it, because fragmented sleep will drive you crazy and mess up your whole biorhythm.

How do you know they’re full? When you see them falling asleep with relaxed hands, when their hands are clenched in fists, the baby isn’t sleeping relaxed. When their hands are open, they’re sleeping relaxed. That’s the moment for mom to catch some sleep too. Some good minutes of sleep, because usually the baby sleeps about half an hour. Why only half an hour? Because in that half hour, the baby digests the milk, and after half an hour, they might wake up hungry again and want to nurse.

So, my dear, do you want to succeed and have a content, full, and calm baby? Then, please, take these signs and understand that your baby will not be separated from you, no matter how much you want or don’t want this. The child needs you non-stop.

Why does the baby cry? Well, there are several, let’s say, reasons why the baby cries. I’ll give you a top seven. First, babies cry because they want to be in their mother’s arms. The second reason a baby might cry: they cry from exhaustion. Why? They were overstimulated? Too many things happened, and when you’re too tired, you can’t sleep from exhaustion. The same thing happens with babies. They were overstimulated, which is related to exhaustion and overstimulation.

Then, the fourth reason a baby might cry is as a release or discharge, expressing frustration—maybe they had a difficult birth, the mother wasn’t there, they were taken away, handled roughly, and so on. Then they cry from loneliness and abandonment. Most women who raise their child—see, don’t hold them or they’ll get used to it. That child will cry from loneliness because they feel abandoned. That’s trauma, clearly. The sixth reason a baby might cry is simply from hunger. So, the baby doesn’t always cry because they need the breast. If you pick them up and want to comfort their crying, pain, frustration, exhaustion, and all that, you’ll see you’ll understand the signs much faster than if you immediately give them the breast. Because we don’t always cry from hunger either. We cry for many other emotional reasons, and when we cry, we want to be held. That’s all. To be listened to, seen, understood. That’s all. We don’t want more, we don’t want explanations, we just want someone to be there with us, meaning the mother.

And only in the seventh case does the baby cry from physical discomfort, pain, or colic. So, you see, colic is last, number seven. Before colic, most babies cry for these reasons: they want to be held by their mother, they cry from exhaustion, they cry because they were overstimulated, they release because they need to. If the mother is agitated, they release the mother’s agitation, otherwise they can’t sleep. Loneliness, abandonment from birth, maybe they remember. Hunger? Yes. You’ll see if they’re hungry, because then they’ll go crazy when they smell the breast and want it, and show you. And only in seventh place is physical discomfort, pain, or colic.

So, how do we prevent baby colic? My dear, give birth naturally, or if you have a C-section, colonize the baby with vaginal bacteria, because this doesn’t happen with a C-section. The baby doesn’t pass through the vaginal canal and isn’t colonized with the mother’s microbiome, which helps digest breast milk and colonize with good bacteria needed to live in this world. Because they come from an underwater world. The first breastfeeding should be at most thirty minutes after birth, to get the colostrum, because colostrum is that orange milk. I’ll explain this in the breastfeeding course. It colonizes the baby’s intestinal tract and starts the correct digestion of breast milk.

How do we prevent baby colic? Through the magic hour, skin to skin, and in the first two months, sleeping with the baby on your chest. That’s why you need to be emotionally relaxed, informed, and balanced, because that’s what it means to have a content and calm baby—if they’re not crying, there’s nothing wrong. How do we prevent colic? Now you know the signs of hunger and don’t let the baby cry. They don’t need to cry for you to realize they’re hungry. Avoid air swallowing, don’t starve them, don’t breastfeed on a schedule, but on demand. After breastfeeding, put the baby on your shoulder, just like in this picture, to help them burp. You don’t need to jiggle them to make them vomit, just leave them like that, because air is lighter and will rise and come out as a burp.

So, if you’re relaxed, informed, and emotionally balanced, and don’t lose your temper, then nothing will happen to your baby and they won’t have colic, because you understand that when they cry, it’s not from colic.

Now, another question many women don’t know what to do about, because they’ve heard all sorts of controversies: how often should you alternate breasts? That is, when do you put them on one breast, when on the other? My dear, from one feeding session to the next, you can alternate breasts, or after you feel the first breast is empty, put them on the other. How do you know it’s empty? You’ll hear the baby stop swallowing and just sucking. That’s when the milk from one breast is gone, so you put them on the other, which is probably already flowing. Now, if the milk is gone from the other breast too, start over with the first one. Because you learned in previous lessons how lactation works and every time you put the baby to the breast, it starts the same cycle. So breast milk doesn’t run out. That’s very important.

Now, another very controversial topic: growth spurts. What does that mean? Some people invented certain times when the baby supposedly grows and has growth spurts. My dear, until eighteen years old, your child is in a continuous growth spurt, so it doesn’t matter if they’re two months, three months, six weeks, seven weeks, ten weeks, seven months, six months. It doesn’t matter. Growth spurts are all the time. What does a growth episode mean and why are women afraid of growth spurts? Because they think the growth spurt comes like a monster and suddenly you have to do something extra. No, my dear. What do you do when the baby grows? They’re always growing. They’ll stay at the breast longer. That’s it. That means it’s a growth spurt. If they stay at the breast longer, they eat more.

How do you increase your milk supply if you think your body doesn’t have enough because you’ve hit a growth spurt at however many months? Well, you don’t do anything. You breastfeed when your baby asks, probably more often. And you breastfeed especially at night. Why? At night, since you’re half asleep, breastfeeding goes easier and stimulates better, because you’re not thinking, worrying, or getting frustrated—you’re in a calmer state. So breastfeed, my dear, at night, breastfeed on demand, and your baby will have no problem with their growth spurts or whatever. That’s about those myths you’ve heard so many times. Information matters, because many things we’ve heard aren’t even true.

See you at the next course. Thank you.
