Hello, my dear! I am Ditta Depner and I am glad to see you again at this lesson about the umbilical cord. Today, I will talk to you a bit about the anatomy of the umbilical cord, more specifically about the blood vessels that pass through this cord. I will discuss the cartilage inside the cord. We will talk about the pulsation of the cord, which cannot be obstructed. I will explain the role of the three blood vessels, because there are three blood vessels in the cord, meaning the blood circulation through the vein and the two arteries. We will also discuss the emotional causes related to the umbilical cord, the anomalies of the umbilical cord, the transfer of stem cells when the cord is pulsating, and the importance of delayed cord clamping after birth. When and who can cut the umbilical cord? You will receive an answer to this question as well, so that you are prepared to request these things in your birth plan at the hospital where you choose to give birth.

Let’s start, then, with the anatomy of the umbilical cord. This is what an umbilical cord looks like, and I know it’s not a very clear image, but these were the only images I could find that actually show what the umbilical cord looks like. You can see that this umbilical cord is not an empty tube through which blood flows depending on positioning or inertia. Why do I say this? Because I have had many discussions, even with medical staff, who believed that the umbilical cord through which blood flows to and from the baby is like a hose. If you lift the baby higher and leave the placenta lower, the blood will drain from the baby into the placenta. And if you do the opposite, the placenta will drain its blood into the baby’s body. This would be valid if we had the rule of communicating vessels, meaning an empty tube through which blood or water could flow, depending on which end is lower. The problem is that the umbilical cord is not a hose. It is full, and inside it there are three blood vessels surrounded by a very cartilaginous gel. This gel is called Wharton’s jelly. This gel actually has the thickness and composition of cartilage similar to that of the earlobe. Now, it’s not the lower lobe, but the cartilage higher up. Touch your ear and see how strong and firm this cartilage is and how it cannot be crushed. Because it’s impossible! The same thing happens with the cord, which, yes, has this cartilage precisely so that the three blood vessels cannot be crushed in any position or in any way. Here you can see much better what that cartilaginous gel looks like. Here you can see the vein, which is the thickest, and here you see the two arteries, which are much thinner than the vein.

So, to be clear, the umbilical cord is not a hose. This cartilage called Wharton’s jelly, yes, its role is to never stop the blood circulation from the placenta and back to the baby in the womb. So, no matter what the baby does, how it grabs, knots, squeezes, or pulls, the umbilical cord cannot be strangled, because it’s impossible. Even if you press with two fingers and with all your strength, you would not be able to crush that gel, because it has the consistency of cartilage, which, as I said, you can feel in your ear. Now, if you press the umbilical cord, it is impossible to compress or crush it to the point of stopping the pulsation. Even after the placenta is born, and the pulsation has stopped, you still cannot squeeze it to strangle it. Because that Wharton’s jelly remains there and does not allow compression.

This is what the umbilical cord looks like. It might look like something out of a horror movie, right? With a nose and a mouth, but it’s not really like that. We have one vein and two arteries. Through this umbilical cord, many transfers occur. This is what an umbilical cord looks like. Here you can see the two thinner arteries and the thicker vein. On the edge, you can also see it. This is what the cartilage looks like, which surrounds the three vessels. It is very dense and impossible to compress. Why do I keep repeating this? Because… Many doctors make women believe that the cord is very fragile. It is not fragile at all. No matter how hard you press, you will never be able to crush it. So, blood circulation cannot be stopped in the umbilical cord. And by the way, this blood circulation can be observed after birth, when the baby still has the cord attached and the cord is still pulsating. You can simply see how it moves, how it throbs, you can actually see the pulsation with the naked eye. All you have to do is look, because it would be too important to miss the moment and not try to feel how the pulsation is, how strong it is. And even if you press very hard, you still couldn’t stop it.

I’m telling you from my experience, after I gave birth to my son, I wanted the father to cut the umbilical cord and he was given the scissors to actually cut it. And I looked at him out of the corner of my eye and he kept cutting and seemed to say, “Oh dear, it’s not working, these scissors aren’t cutting.” And the doctor said, “No, no, it’s cutting! The cord is just that tough!” And I said, “Fine, if you won’t do it, I will!” And honestly, I pressed those scissors so hard that I actually felt sorry to cut like that, because it felt like the scissors were dull. In the end, I didn’t cut the cord. The midwife did it because it just seemed so wow, so strange! How tough can it be? So, I wasn’t curious enough to cut the umbilical cord myself. But by the way, it’s like when you inaugurate something, a company, a building, a business, and someone comes and cuts the ribbon. This is the ribbon-cutting ritual. Meaning, you created that thing. You are somehow the parent of that project. And you cut the ribbon, as if now this child detaches from me and goes into the world, because he came for this experience. That’s the ritual of ribbon cutting when we cut the child’s umbilical cord.

The idea is that in modern society everything goes fast-forward, and people no longer know why they cut the umbilical cord so quickly. They haven’t asked themselves, at least those who practice this profession, they don’t ask themselves why they cut the umbilical cord in the first twenty seconds, depriving the child of stem cells and of about thirty milliliters of blood. That’s another matter.

And now, a drawing. We have two veins and one—no, we have one vein and two arteries. So here the drawing isn’t quite right. Anyway, the vein is the red one, and the two arteries are the blue ones. That’s why the umbilical cord contains a thicker vein and two thinner arteries, which wrap around the vein. Here you can also see the vein, which is larger, wider, and the two arteries marked in red, which are thinner, and the Wharton’s jelly. You can also see the outline of the umbilical cord, which does not allow the compression of the two, three blood vessels.

Now we see again the vein that leaves the placenta, which forms in the umbilical cord and carries oxygenated blood to the baby’s organs, through the navel, directly to the heart, liver, lungs, and so on. Then the two arteries, you see them here in purple, thinner, collect the waste and carry it back to the placenta. Now, what happens with this waste in the placenta? It is taken up by the mother’s body, so, my dear, you will need to drink twice as much water as you did before. Why? Because you metabolize the baby’s waste as well, and your liver, if not helped, will not find it easy to metabolize waste from two people. So, if you’ve heard that you need to eat for two, that is totally wrong. It’s not about eating, because not everything you eat reaches the baby, but the placenta collects the nutrients and delivers them to the baby. But you need to drink for two, because you metabolize the baby’s waste as well. So yes, your liver needs to be washed and helped by water, otherwise you cannot metabolize the waste easily and, let’s say, without fuel, right?

Now, any kind of length anomaly. For example, an umbilical cord that is too short or too long. Usually, the cord measures between twenty and twenty-four inches, which is absolutely sufficient for a baby to reach the mother’s chest after birth. Or there is another anomaly, which is a more recently discovered specialty by some doctors, who find the absence of a blood vessel in the cord. Usually, an artery is missing, so we have one vein and one artery, because through one comes oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood, and through the other, which is just one artery, not two, the waste will be carried away. And there are thousands of children who function perfectly well like this and nothing happens to them. There is, yes, an umbilical cord with only one artery and one vein. Absolutely nothing to be afraid of.

The idea is as follows. What do these anomalies reflect? Too short, too long, or the absence of an artery, which are usually two and here there is only one. The absence or the length or how short it is reflects, on a subtle level, an unresolved emotional problem or conflict of the mother, either consciously or unconsciously. And here it’s about closeness, about nourishment, about rejection or acceptance of the baby. I do not want to accuse anyone, it’s not about me, I just want you to think on a subtle level: why did your baby need only one, let’s say, artery? Why did he need a very short cord, so as not to waste time, to be very close to you, or a very long cord to be as far away as possible? Here you might discover something, because there are no general rules for these aspects. Usually, you will find exactly, exactly what you need, the core. Why? Because when you think of something, the subconscious actually tells you that this is it. So you can trust what your subconscious tells you by the fact that you thought of that thing, while I, for example, would not have thought of it. Every experience and every, let’s say, emotional conflict is very personal on a subtle level. So if something comes to your mind, it means yes, it is clearly related to you. And it doesn’t have to be related to anyone else, because every conflict is absolutely super personal and very characteristic not only to us, but maybe to an entire generation or five generations back, who had some emotional conflicts related to the umbilical cord, to closeness or length or the absence of a blood vessel.

Well, in exactly these twenty, twelve minutes, along with the plasma, meaning the placental blood, stem cells that have formed in the placenta over nine months will be transferred into the newborn’s body for the first time. And here you see once again the two arteries—there can be just one—and the thicker vein, yes? And the stem cells will be transferred through this vein from the placenta into the baby after birth. Stem cell banks, speaking of business, I have a special course about this, will only convince you to leave your baby without these intelligent cells, because they need them. They collect them, the rest is lost and remains in the placenta for nothing, because nothing else reaches the baby. Why? Because the umbilical cord is cut in the first twenty, thirty seconds. What is collected is collected from the pulsation of the placenta. The rest is barbarism. You are actually depriving your own child of some cells that will not be repeated, maybe only in the baby teeth. If you ever keep them, you will have your child’s stem cells, but otherwise, these are the truly intelligent cells of your child and they have the right to reach the child’s body and not some bank that who knows what will do with them.

So, wouldn’t it be more natural for you to cut the ribbon yourselves, to do the honors as at any inauguration of a company, business, idea, project, and so on? And you see that after the cord no longer pulses, it is flaccid, white, and this father actually cuts the cord with a blade, because, as I said, it is very cartilaginous. So I wish you to be curious and to do the honors for your child at the moment of welcoming them into this world. Thank you for watching! See you at the next course.
