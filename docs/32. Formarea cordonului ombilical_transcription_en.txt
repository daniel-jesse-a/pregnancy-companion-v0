(music in the background) Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you again for the lesson about the formation of the umbilical cord. In this lesson, I will talk to you about how and from what the umbilical cord is formed, and especially when during pregnancy. I will present the yolk sac, or where the embryo is nourished from until the second trimester. We will discuss when the cardiac activity begins, immediately after conception. That is, at how many weeks we will be able to see or hear the heartbeat. I will show you the development of the embryo in images and we will talk about the amniotic sac, the formation of the cord, and the placenta. We will discuss the functions of the umbilical cord, its anatomy. I will explain how this umbilical cord nourishes the child’s body and how it sends waste back to the placenta. After that, we will talk about the moment after birth and the amount of blood circulated between the baby and the placenta through the umbilical cord. We will also discuss the pulsation of the umbilical cord after birth, its duration, and physiology.

So let’s start with this lesson about the umbilical cord, the connection between mother and the baby in the womb. As you can see in this image, I want to describe the image a bit so you can understand, anatomically speaking, how your baby fits in the womb. And we will take it step by step. Here is the vagina, here we have the anus and colon. What you see here is the entrance to the uterus, that is, the end of the vagina, where the cervix is located. The cervix is closed, as in this image, and in this opening is the mucus plug, or the gelatinous plug. It is also called the mucus plug or gelatinous plug. This gelatinous plug serves to protect the child from all kinds of bacteria that should not enter the uterus. What you see next to the uterus is the urinary bladder. That’s why I will now explain better why, as the pregnancy grows, you urinate more often. This is the pubic bone, the urethra. The baby, who is already turned for birth in his amniotic sac, and attached to the wall of the uterus is the placenta from which the umbilical cord starts—you can see it here—and it reaches the baby’s navel. Otherwise, the small intestine, stomach, diaphragm, liver, and lungs. Yes? You will see that during pregnancy not only your belly grows, but also your breasts, at least by a size. So it’s time for pictures.

Good, let’s see what nourishes the embryo until the end of the first trimester. You can see it here. It doesn’t look human, but this is how all embryos look, because they go through some primate phases before becoming a little child, a fetus. What you see here is indeed a little eye, the nose, probably some buds for the hands. The legs are not visible yet, and this is the spine, which is still like a little tail.

Now, until the formation of the placenta, which you may have heard about, and I talk about the placenta quite a lot in my courses, because it is the most important organ that nourishes your baby. In the first trimester, the baby does not have a placenta, because the placenta is still developing. The nutrients are drawn from a little sac called the yolk sac. In this sac there is a kind of yolk, like in chicken eggs, from which the baby feeds and grows. At the same time, because his digestion does not function until birth, he will have another sac in which he will transmit waste. This is called the allantois, and the amniotic sac surrounds the baby in his amniotic fluid, and as protection, which includes both sacs, the yolk sac and the waste sac, there will be the chorionic sac, which wraps and protects the baby. Then there is another kind of shell, like an egg, which actually contains albumin precisely for nourishment, to create exactly the moist and warm environment in which the embryo can develop.

So, from this little yolk sac, the embryo is nourished for twelve weeks, and the bread, the chicken soup or fal ノ So the point is that we want to keep the normal cycle of dissecting. We want to learn to make the dog tongue and big. We enter Dani. From the waste sac, the umbilical cord will later form towards the placenta. By the end of the first trimester. The yolk sac will be the source of nourishment until the placenta develops in the uterine wall. Here, you can see the embryo better in his amniotic sac, from which the waste sac starts, at the end of which the placenta forms, you can see it, and this green sac is the nutrient sac, that is, the yolk sac, which, as they say, has something vital in it. Probably that’s why in Romanian it’s called “vitellin.” It contains that yolk which the embryo consumes to grow. When it grows bigger and passes the first trimester, the placenta is already sufficiently developed to take over the function of nourishment, not just the function of collecting the waste that the baby transmits through the umbilical cord to the placenta.

Why? The child is nourished, but the waste does not reach his digestive system, because the baby’s digestive system is activated only after birth. Do you know when? After the first breastfeeding. Then digestion starts and everything makes sense. Good. The yolk sac, I am showing it to you now in the image, is the energy reserve of the embryo until the placenta forms. Pl you decide to make this huge move in呵 tiếng cater-м-first, during which there was no ambiguous form and nothing at the nuclear level to maintain this development process. Staff-related اسلام de katadyn you are a superb electrician. But that only alleviates your sensation. But that is not realistic. That you are also my lubricant clothing store, a training to live for the spring of two thousand and four systems and deliverance for daniel.hog대의 rental for immigrants. Everything makes sense. Good. The yolk sac, I am showing it to you now in the image. It is the energy reserve of the embryo until the placenta forms. The placenta is this big thing. Here I am pointing to it with the mouse.

That is where the first blood elements are formed, and the first flow will be drawn by the embryo into that empty space. So, the blood flow from the yolk sac will activate the baby’s heart and its cardiac activity will begin. So, the first heartbeats in the embryo occur at about 3 weeks or 22 days after conception, not by ultrasound. After conception means about 5-6 weeks by ultrasound. Why do we calculate like this? Very simple. When you go to the doctor, he calculates 40 weeks of pregnancy, or 41 would be more correct. For the first pregnancy, it’s 41 weeks and 3 days. And—why is it so long? Because it’s more than 9 months. Because we also have two more weeks, those from your last menstruation, that is, from the first day of your last menstruation, until fertilization, there is probably a time of two weeks or at least 10 days. That’s why it matters if you say 22 days from conception or calculated according to the ultrasound, which also adds those two weeks, even though the baby did not exist then, was not even conceived.

I hope you now understand the difference. Let’s see what a baby looks like at 8 weeks after conception. The baby is as big as a bean, floating in his amniotic fluid sac, playing with the umbilical cord, and the placenta is still developing. What you see here, more translucent, is the yolk sac, which, as the placenta grows, empties more and more to facilitate the transition to nourishment—uh, bodily nourishment from the yolk sac to the placenta. That is, nourishment will no longer happen from the yolk sac, but directly from the placenta. This is what a baby looks like at 10 weeks of gestation. The umbilical cord here can be seen very well, with a thicker vein and two smaller arteries. The vein, yes, and the two arteries are already very well defined at 10 weeks.

At 13 weeks of gestation, the umbilical cord already looks much more pronounced. Uncontrolled limb movements begin. Why? Because the baby, the embryo, is perfecting its musculature, and the umbilical cord starts to wrap around the legs, around the hands, around the neck. You have to think that during pregnancy, the baby actually does 7,000 somersaults and will wrap and unwrap itself many times, so all this should not worry you, because it is absolutely normal and all babies do the same. About 85% of babies are born with some wrapping of the umbilical cord.

Now let’s see a bit what the umbilical cord is or what it represents physically. Physically, the cord indicates the connection between the mother’s body and the baby’s body. It is somehow their communication thread or inter... Interchange, I don’t know. The child receives the nourishment transmitted by the mother in the placenta and receives it in his body through the umbilical cord and, on the other hand, at the same time, gives back the waste he cannot digest, because, as I told you, digestion is not yet active until after birth, and sends the waste back into the mother’s body.

Now, what does the umbilical cord mean emotionally? The umbilical cord signifies the unconscious bond between mother and child, of attraction or rejection. It depends on how you view your child, what feelings he provokes in you. How this pregnancy came about, whether it is a wanted pregnancy, or somehow unwanted, an accident, an incident. This attraction or rejection is given by emotions, conscious and especially unconscious emotions. For example, if you were an unwanted child, and your parents did not want you and even wanted to abort you, it is possible that through this pregnancy, you will manage to heal that lack of love or somehow that desire not to keep you, by wanting a child very much, and this desire heals your own trauma. But there can also be rejection of the pregnancy. And then certain things happen. For example, emotionally, if the woman, for various reasons, has a lot of worries like “Oh no, will something happen to my child? Oh no, is he being nourished properly? Is he growing properly? Is he developing properly? Does he know what to do? Could I influence him?” You are already driving him crazy. And the length of the cord may depend on your emotional state, because it develops depending on how much you want to take over everything or be very close to the baby. So it happens that women who are very concerned and worried form a shorter cord than usual for their baby. So there are many situations, and each situation is particular. And I warmly invite you to my live online course with me, where we explain all these things and discover in which category your parents somehow placed you and with what, let’s say, unconscious memories you go further to the next generation with this child.

So, let’s see a bit. The umbilical cord is inside the amniotic sac. Do you see it here? The amniotic sac has a white edge, and the umbilical cord gathers all the nutrients from the placenta and forms inside the amniotic sac. Outside, so not in the sac, is the placenta. Why? The child can be born with the amniotic sac and, of course, attached to the cord. That does not mean the placenta detaches at the same time. The placenta remains attached to the uterus, because even when the baby is born, he still needs oxygen supplementation. Why? Because on his way to being born, he has no other source of oxygen to the brain except from the umbilical cord. A normal-length umbilical cord is 20-24 inches long, so absolutely sufficient for the baby, after birth, to reach directly to his mother’s chest. And now, the umbilical cord is the channel through which the baby is fed and oxygenated until birth. What you see here is the placenta, which is very vascularized. Here we have maternal arteries, for example, like this reddish one, yes, and maternal veins that go to the placenta. But the mother’s blood never mixes with the baby’s blood. Even though the placenta comes with its own arteries and veins and capillaries, that is, those of the baby, the mother’s veins and arteries do not meet the baby’s veins and arteries in the placenta. They only transmit, let’s say, nutrients. It’s like a relay race. Even if there are five runners, the baton is only one that must reach the finish. Exactly so with nutrients. The nutrients are the baton, and the messengers are the maternal arteries and veins, and the baby’s circulatory system takes over and delivers the baton, that is, the nutrients, to the baby. I hope this is clear enough, and the umbilical cord is effectively the cord that feeds and oxygenates the fetus until birth.

Now, what do we have here? The placenta is the child’s external organ for 9 months. After 9 months, the placenta finishes its activity and detaches from the baby’s navel and no longer exists. So, after birth, about five or six days later, the placenta, if left to detach on its own, as was done in the past, after five or six days, it would detach directly from the navel, without any other intervention. Such a birth is called a lotus birth, and I explain it in the course about lotus births and about PLAC TTC.

Good. The blood circulation from the placenta to the child. Everything that goes to the child is oxygenated and full of nutrients. Why? Because it must supplement everything that means the baby and blood circulation. At the same time, the opposite happens, from the child to the placenta. This is the residual blood and it goes effectively through the two blue arteries, you can see them here, to the placenta. So the vein is thicker and brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby directly to the liver, circulatory system, and so on. And the two arteries collect the waste and take it back to the placenta, where it is collected by the mother. And now, so you understand, during pregnancy, blood flows continuously between the fetus and the placenta through the umbilical cord. As you see here, in this image. This is a baby in the womb and this is a baby after birth. What is different is the umbilical cord. Here you see it has two little tubes that later, I don’t know, probably resorb. Here, during pregnancy, they are very thick. Yes, you can see them. This is a ligament, this white one that keeps the uterus attached. I think it’s the pelvic area, I’m not sure exactly. Yes, I’m not sure. Wait, it says here. Yes, it’s a ligament. I don’t know what that round thing is at the bottom. Interesting. And here you can see how, during pregnancy, the two veins come from and collect the residual blood and take it to the placenta, while the artery effectively feeds the baby’s main arteries in the womb. So, all this circulation works one way during pregnancy, and after birth everything changes and works very differently. Good. Perfect. Oh, and another very important difference before the baby is born. You see that the highly oxygenated blood goes directly to the liver, heart, and so on, the vital organs, after which the waste is collected and sent back to the placenta. Here it will be the opposite. After the baby is born, the blood vessels that collected the waste will become the main blood vessels, that is, arteries that will carry a lot of oxygen to all the organs. So many things change during and after birth, especially. So it’s not all as we know it works in a person, but things change immediately after birth.

Now, what is the amount of blood circulated between the placenta and the baby during the 9 months? Together, the placenta and the baby circulate about 90 ml of blood. That means a small bottle of water of about 100 ml. Do you know how much that is? Have you drunk from such a small bottle of water? This is the blood that is in continuous movement between—Go back to the wounds framed at the edge of the ankle Bjorn TOPByBjorn. Back and forth, the placenta sends nutrients and oxygen. The child sends waste, so this back and forth is always active and together circulates about 90 ml of blood. Of which the placenta permanently contains about one third of the baby’s blood, so one third is held by the placenta, although not all the time, but there is always one third in this circulation in the placenta, and the other two thirds are in the baby’s body. But they are in constant motion. What does one third mean? It means about 30 ml of blood that is in the placenta all the time during pregnancy. The remaining 60 ml is in the fetus’s body during pregnancy. So the baby has about 60 ml all the time in the body, but another 30, which are also his, because they make the same blood circuit, are always in the placenta. So, between the placenta and the baby in the womb, there is a permanent pulsation through the umbilical cord, which sends and receives blood from one side to the other. So there is an uninterrupted circulation between the two.

Now, after the first seconds after birth, the placenta will pulse blood only in one direction, so there is no longer that bilateral exchange between the two. The placenta, after the baby is born, will pump only in one direction, that is, it will pump all the blood from the placenta into the baby. Because the placenta understands that the baby has been born and will finish, immediately after pulsing this blood into the baby’s body, its life. So the placenta, what? After the baby is born and takes his first breath, it will know to pump the blood only in one direction, that is, into the baby. Why? Because with this placental blood transfer, the baby’s body will be filled with those 30 ml of blood that are his, and this pulsation lasts about 20 minutes. That’s why we need to be patient with the cord, which pulses for about 20 minutes after birth. You should know that it’s not just 30 ml of blood that is pumped from the placenta into the baby, but very importantly, for the first time in the child’s life, besides blood, his stem cells are also pumped. All the stem cells are intelligent cells that will reach the baby’s body right after birth, because that’s how nature intended. After that rather strong and intense transition, the baby will need his stem cells precisely to repair any kind of problems that might have appeared after birth. So, as long as the umbilical cord is still pulsing, and this can be felt by holding it with two fingers, exactly as in this image, the placental blood transfer with stem cells is happening for the first time in the newborn’s life.

When the cord looks like you see in this image, yes? The difference between the previous image and this one is very clear. Here we have pulsation, you can see it, here we no longer have pulsation. The umbilical cord becomes white, soft, and flaccid. Then we know for sure that the placental blood with all the stem cells has been transferred. And this, this thing is finished and has been completed in its entirety. From that moment, when the umbilical cord turns white, it means we have a complete transfer, and the placenta can finish its function, that is, it will stop pulsating and the next process will begin: to be born, because it must be delivered, after which it becomes an inert organ. So, as long as the cord is pulsing, we have placental blood transfer with stem cells. After the pulsation stops, the placenta begins to detach and will soon be born. In another video, I explain exactly how this happens. Thank you for paying attention and for taking notes on everything we discussed in this lesson. See you at the next course.
