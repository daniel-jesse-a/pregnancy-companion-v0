Hello, my dear, and welcome to a lesson about epidural or peridural analgesia—it’s the same thing. Today, I will tell you what the epidural contains and share things that no one else has told you, because no one goes into detail to find out what substances are in this analgesia, so often used in, uh, pregnancy and childbirth—actually, in childbirth, not pregnancy. I will tell you about fentanyl, uh, and the difference between heroin, morphine, and this fentanyl, and we will talk about fentanyl citrate and its side effects. We will, of course, discuss the harmful effects of the epidural, which again, no one tells you about. We will also talk about the risks of the epidural and the most common side effects of this analgesia. Ten adverse effects on the mother and ten adverse effects on the baby. This is, let’s say, the most important lesson about the epidural. I do not want to discourage you from considering this analgesia, but if you do, I want you to have the correct information so you can make this choice knowingly, especially since the effects on the baby will be seen in the first days and maybe even later. Because the baby suffers the most. And one more very important thing, there are alternative options for epidural or birth analgesia, which I discuss when talking about water birth. And there are so many ways to reduce pain sensations that it’s a shame to stop at the first and most popular one, because that doesn’t mean it’s the best or healthiest. Welcome, then, to the course about the epidural! Let’s see what epidural analgesia contains. What is the difference between analgesia and anesthesia? Analgesia, um, numbs only a part of the body, in this case your pelvis, while anesthesia, uh, affects your whole body. When anesthesia is administered, it spreads everywhere and you can’t walk or be conscious. Considering that every pregnant woman avoids caffeine, alcohol, or other medications, and I know you have made and continue to make efforts to avoid such substances, let’s take a look at what wonderful ingredients the epidural contains. Here, you see, this is an information leaflet for the epidural that contains fentanyl, bupivacaine, um, and, of course, normal saline for any kind of, let’s say, infusion that enters your body. Let’s see what fentanyl is. And here, the irony is, these are not just pictures from the internet, but are actually taken from the website of the Forensic Lab of the New Hampshire State Police, so from a police laboratory. And here it shows you the dose that can be lethal for a person. Heroin, you see, is more than fentanyl. Fentanyl—this is the lethal dose, just a few, I don’t even know how to say, crumbs, right? Fentanyl is actually the chemical equivalent of heroin. It is a hundred times more lethal than morphine. So we’re talking about the epidural, right? So you don’t get the impression that we’re in a police lab talking about drugs here. So what you see in this image is the lethal dose for heroin and the lethal dose for fentanyl. This is just so you understand what is in the epidural that everyone recommends for childbirth. And now, yes, it’s not just fentanyl. It’s fentanyl citrate. Fentanyl citrate is a drug, a narcotic, a very powerful synthetic opioid, which is addictive. It is used only in cancer treatment, in unbearable pain, because it has many dangerous side effects. Wow! And we use it in childbirth, right? Because, well, it’s cool. So it is used only for pain—and that kind of excruciating pain. When someone suffers from unbearable pain in cancer. When, as they say, morphine is also used. And yes, it is the most powerful of all, because the other medications do not have the effect needed for such pain. It’s very powerful and, let’s say, dangerous, because it creates addiction and should never be used for any pain not associated with cancer. These things are not invented by me. You can find this information if you search for it online. It’s not, let’s say, a conspiracy. These are just truths that, yes, we need to know. And now let’s see what are the most feared side effects of the epidural. Here, on the right side of the screen, I’ve put information from a medical leaflet, yes? So these are not things I’ve gathered myself. They are from the Epidural Leaflet. The most feared side effects of the epidural are collapse, cardiovascular collapse, heart rhythm problems, it can cause hypertension or hypotension, and pulse problems. That’s why, when the epidural is administered, the anesthesiologist does not leave the woman giving birth. He stays there because he needs to intervene and manage any of these problems related to heart rhythm, pulse—meaning your heart can stop, right? In addition to back pain, cardiovascular collapse, asthma, tinnitus, shivering, very low breathing, right? So these are just a few. Let’s see what opioids are. They are all those medications ending in -caine, such as lidocaine, bupivacaine, heroin, cocaine. So all medications or drugs ending in -caine. You see that lidocaine, which is used at the dentist, uh, bupivacaine, which is used in the epidural, is the same drug as heroin or cocaine. All these opioids also cause the following side effects: twenty-three percent fever is the highest, although I explained this in my other videos. It’s even called epidural fever, which comes with what? With antibiotics, of course! Because any fever symptom is treated with antibiotics. That’s their procedure. It doesn’t matter that the woman doesn’t have a fever, let’s say, due to an infection, but it’s fever as a side effect of the epidural. Fourteen percent of women who get an epidural will have a sudden drop in blood pressure, which can cause many problems, especially for the baby. But now we’re talking only about mothers. One percent can have chronic headaches. The epidural increases the risk by two and a half times for a C-section. So, if you don’t necessarily want a C-section, don’t opt for the epidural. Choose any other healthy pain relief options and the risk will triple for an instrumental birth. If you follow my course on childbirth, you’ll understand what an instrumental birth means, because I explain it. And instrumental birth means forceps or vacuum, which is not pleasant for the mother or the baby. So, what’s in an epidural injection? Bupivacaine, ropivacaine, the fentanyl we talked about, and sufentanil. So, wonderful things, but of course, half of the women who follow me or who find me and hear about the epidural are simply horrified by what they learn. And the first reaction is, “Oh, what nonsense! What an exaggeration!” It’s not an exaggeration. I’m neither the first nor the last to talk about the epidural, I’m simply the one who says something in Romania, because elsewhere, the whole internet is abuzz about the harmful effects of the epidural on mothers and babies. But very few have the courage to speak out. The epidural prolongs any labor, because it stops contractions, and restarting them happens only with medication. So, at the moment of the epidural, when the woman injects this cocktail into the epidural space, it will stop contractions. And this, somehow, yes, will stall labor. So the epidural comes with what? With oxytocin. Because if we no longer have contractions, those contractions must be induced with oxytocin. So they go together. So epidural without oxytocin does not exist, because that’s what the epidural does—it stops contractions. And now the side effects on the mother’s body. Fever, which I told you is called epidural fever, leads to the standard protocol for a febrile woman in labor: intravenous antibiotics until she gives birth, even though there may be no infection or inflammation. So, clearly, there’s no chance to avoid being stuffed with antibiotics, which not only ruin our microbiome, but also our flora, and so on—I won’t go into details. When you go through the breastfeeding course, you’ll understand why antibiotics are truly the enemies of the microbiome we pass on to our child. So, please watch the video about breastfeeding, because it will help you a lot to understand why antibiotics are not recommended during pregnancy or birth, especially when not necessary. Let’s see the side effects on the newborn. If the woman develops a fever, a newborn from a febrile mother will automatically be separated from the mother in the first seconds after birth. So, no chance for the magic hour, unfortunately... And the baby will be kept on antibiotics for at least twenty-four hours, without other medical reasons, because that’s the standard treatment. So, goodbye microbiome, goodbye flora! Goodbye and hello! Digestive problems, colic, and the whole package. Please also follow my course on lactation to understand exactly what happens. And now, if the mother’s blood pressure drops suddenly, which can help a woman with high blood pressure, yes? But if you already have low blood pressure during pregnancy, it can lead to fainting and loss of consciousness. So, by the way, where do you think high blood pressure comes from in a pregnant woman? Because they say, “Oh, your blood pressure is rising.” My dear, your blood pressure rises when you have a lot of emotional pressure. High blood pressure can sometimes be regulated just by proper water intake. So you need to drink more water or more fluids. And because of the emotional pressure of “Oh, I’m becoming a mother!” “Oh, I have to quit my job!” “Oh, oh, oh!” The whole range. And please, watch my videos about pregnancy myths. There I explain very nicely what happens when we have hypertension or hypotension. And now, if the mother’s blood pressure drops suddenly, the baby in the womb will feel fetal stress and will have to be delivered urgently by C-section. These are the effects on the newborn of the epidural that the woman consents to. If the epidural—no, when the epidural stops the mother’s contractions, all the hormones that were driving labor are actually withdrawn. What are the hormones that drive labor? Please watch the video about contractions and you’ll find out which hormones. But I’ll tell you briefly now: it’s about your body’s endogenous oxytocin, not the porcine-derived one introduced by infusion. So endogenous oxytocin and endorphins, which are anesthetics and relaxants for the mind, as they say. So, when our hormones, which are active in labor, are blocked by the epidural because contractions stop, our hormones stop and say, “Oh, I don’t know what’s happening. I’ve never encountered such a situation.” They simply disappear because they no longer understand the situation. And this clearly leads to blocked dilation and, implicitly, delayed birth and actually prolongs labor, which for an absolutely exhausted woman may seem like a solution. But, as I said, there are also natural alternatives. For example, water birth helps the woman take a break. Exactly the break that the epidural gives her, but in a bad way, yes, and with many side effects on her and the baby, she can get from water birth. Now, what happens when the woman’s contractions stop? Well, the baby is confused because those two hormones, oxytocin and endorphins, are no longer present. That communication between mother and baby ends, that hormonal dance where the baby asked, the mother responded with oxytocin and endorphins, and the baby suddenly feels abandoned in this complex process. The baby feels left alone, because emotionally he experiences and will experience that acute feeling of abandonment, in a process he cannot go through alone, because it’s a process that mother and baby go through together. So, the baby will experience his first feeling of abandonment and it is an acute feeling, and he won’t know what to do and it will... it will steal not just the activity in labor, but simply his birth. Because the baby, no longer having the mother’s cooperation, will no longer participate actively in his own birth. And now, (sighs) the use of animal-derived oxytocin. It’s the only one we have. There is no artificial oxytocin, only the one created by your body, and the one injected by infusion is porcine oxytocin. It’s the only one used to restart labor that was anesthetized by the epidural. Because, as I said, endogenous hormones no longer react. The irony is that in the leaflet for this oxytocin, when not dosed correctly—and the dosing is very delicate—animal-derived oxytocin, the one usually used, can lead to uterine rupture, which can be fatal. When the uterus ruptures, we lose both the uterus and the baby. Very painful contractions, too rapid a rhythm. The contractions are not just painful, they are extremely painful. The rhythm can be non-stop. We no longer have contraction-pause-contraction-pause, but contraction-contraction without pause. I can tell you that I had such a labor with my first child, when they put oxytocin in my vein, because after three days and three nights my contractions were no longer effective. So, the way that oxytocin hurt, I have never experienced such excruciating pain in my life. All these things can lead to an emergency C-section or an instrumental birth, if the woman still manages to deliver vaginally. And now, what does animal oxytocin do to the baby? First of all, it can cause fetal stress, oxygenation problems, and heart problems, and all these lead to an emergency C-section or a traumatic instrumental birth, with forceps or vacuum extractor. Yes, these births are very unpleasant, because neither the baby nor the mother will be okay. Usually, in an instrumental birth, the woman tears, and the baby is left with trauma, having been pulled by the head or left with marks. And yes, it’s not simple. Another side effect of the epidural is headache, back pain. It happens quite often that women have headaches, can’t stand up, and also back pain. I’ve met women who couldn’t even hold their baby in their arms to breastfeed, the pain was so bad. So the hormonal disruption caused by epidural analgesia can lead to postpartum depression. Oh, yes, when the natural birth hormones are disrupted, depression is at the door. Why? Because, biologically speaking, there is—A woman who could not experience her birth because she could no longer fulfill it, and the clear dissatisfaction that comes with an instrumental birth and a birth with anesthesia, clearly comes with the experience that her birth was stolen. Because hormones cannot be tricked by the mind. No matter how wonderful your birth was and you say, “Oh, I’m so glad I had the epidural!” Your hormones will give you that feeling of depression afterward. Why? Because you didn’t perform the birth, your body didn’t perform it. And all these things, due to hormonal disruption, affect maternal feelings as well as the mother’s natural behavior. And this leads to a woman who can barely cope with exhaustion and the intense period after birth. So, even if you think everything was wonderful and perfect, your hormones will go into depression because their birth was stolen. They were responsible for birthing the baby and, because of the intervention, they no longer had that birth experience. Good. Epidural analgesia can cause, according to studies, a disruption of the newborn’s body temperature, which may require spending some time in an incubator. Babies who end up in incubators are deprived of closeness to their mother. They don’t know if they’ll ever see her again and the feeling of abandonment is major. As a pre- and perinatal trauma therapist, I have studied this aspect, and the biggest problems with natural attachment are with babies who have been in incubators. The incubator, although, yes, is a wonderful invention because it keeps a baby alive, and the incubator somehow tries to imitate the womb, but, believe me, the incubator will never replace the feeling the baby had in the mother’s womb or in her arms or skin-to-skin with the mother. So, there are studies and in Australia, they even practice as much skin-to-skin attachment with the mother as possible, even for premature babies. They are taken out, from time to time, from the incubator to be skin-to-skin with their mother, because studies show that those moments of skin-to-skin with the mother are much more beneficial than just staying in the incubator. So babies make leaps in development and growth in their mother’s arms better than in any incubator, no matter how advanced. Know that the human relationship can never be replaced by a machine. Now let’s talk about the metabolism of analgesia toxins, which is full of opioids that will also pass into breast milk. The mother’s liver eliminates these toxins in about three hours. So the mother feeds her baby in the first 30 minutes with milk full of opioids from the anesthesia. So the baby receives fentanyl, bupivacaine, and other products we discussed earlier. OK, the mother metabolizes these toxins in about three hours. They are opioids, not just toxins. The baby cannot metabolize these opioids because his liver is brand new. The liver is not functional until the baby takes his first breath, and his first feeding will activate the liver, digestion, and because of this, the baby’s brand new liver needs at least eight hours and a huge amount of energy to metabolize these opioids. After thirty-six hours after birth, the baby is still eliminating the mother’s analgesia toxins through urine. That’s why, as I said, the liver is activated only after birth, it will be overloaded and will give the newborn a state of drowsiness, which leads to—Well, if the baby is drowsy, the Apgar score, that grade, will be lower because the baby is not alert, natural attachment will be disrupted, because instead of bonding with the mother and recognizing that the whole environment has changed and bonding with the mother in a new way, it will be disrupted because the baby will be drowsy. Breastfeeding will be difficult because the baby is not alert and fully present. That’s why, a baby who received an epidural anesthesia through the mother needs to be woken up even every hour to feed. And, of course, it can lead to neonatal jaundice. So we have a whole list of things that go wrong. Another adverse effect on the mother is postpartum hemorrhage. Epidurals full of opioids plus oxytocin administered to continue labor cause massive and abundant bleeding after birth. So, the woman not only bleeds normally, but bleeds excessively after an epidural, so she will lose a lot of blood. Blood that actually will later turn into milk. So, if she loses a lot of blood, she will lose her vitality. And the chances for breastfeeding, yes, might decrease, because milk is formed from plasma. As long as the woman has a hemorrhage afterward, curettage will follow. Other things will follow that are very unpleasant and unnecessary, because if there was no epidural, there would be no hemorrhage or other issues. Thank you for watching this video. I know it’s shocking to learn so many things about that epidural so praised and loved by women who didn’t have this information, but it will surely help you make the best choices and know that you have many other options, yes, to relieve pain sensations, besides that epidural full of opioids. Thank you and see you in the next video.
