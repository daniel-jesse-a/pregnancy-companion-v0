Hello, my dear! I am Ditta Depner and I am glad to see you again for this lesson about the woman’s vagina during childbirth. Why did I create a separate lesson about the vagina, the perineum, and the pelvis? Because I have noticed that the greatest fears of women—who, out of this fear, choose to give birth by cesarean—are related to how the baby passes through their vagina. When you think about the fact that a baby has to pass through there, it can be terrifying. But today, with this lesson, I want to show you that your vagina was perfectly designed to allow a baby—your baby—to pass through, because no one implants it there, and it will grow exactly as much as it needs to, precisely so it can come out the same way.

We will talk about the initial contractions that dilate the cervix. We will talk about the expulsion contractions that push the baby into the vaginal canal. To help you understand, I will show you images of the anatomy of the vagina and also explain how it works—that is, the physiology of the vagina and how it prepares for birth. You will see that there are several types of vaginas, so you don’t think that some are not different. And you will be able to answer the question: Can every woman give birth vaginally? I will also show you again that all the blockages that occur during birth and during expulsion, when the baby gets stuck in the vagina, are based on emotional blockages. I will also talk to you about positions that can help you ensure a smooth transition of the baby through the vagina.

Let’s talk about this topic to dispel some myths and fears that we have all had and still have, perhaps from stories and everything we have heard about this subject. I want to show you what the cervix looks like and where it is located, so you understand that the difference between the cervix and the vaginal opening is just a few centimeters. Many women confuse the dilation of the cervix with the dilation of the vagina. They are not related. The cervix is inside, at the end of the vagina, and is the first gateway through which the baby’s head must pass to slide easily into the vagina.

This is the cervix, and it is a sphincter that, when labor begins, will open and dilate until it makes enough room for the entire head to pass and slide into the vaginal canal. So, it is the first gateway, after which the baby enters the vagina and has only a few centimeters left to be born. Now, let’s talk about dilation contractions. I have marked them as number one because until the cervix—the first exit gate, where we have the blue arrow—dilates, the baby cannot enter the vagina to be born. These are the dilation contractions of the cervix. After the baby slides into the vagina, we will talk about completely different contractions that feel different.

So, the first part of labor will produce contractions that dilate the first gate, meaning the cervix. These contractions are initially very gentle. For some women, they are not even bothersome, because they can happen even while sleeping. I once mentioned that I had many women who spent, let’s say, the first part of labor—the dilation contractions—sleeping. They slept. Even if they felt something happening in the lower part, they could continue sleeping. It didn’t bother them that much. These dilation contractions last only twenty to thirty seconds and occur at intervals from twenty minutes, and as labor progresses, the intervals decrease to even three minutes apart. These contractions produce the dilation of the cervix. This happens in all births, but women who are free from fear will experience this cervical dilation pleasantly, without fear, without an agonizing sensation of pain, with only mild discomfort. They will not scream in pain, because they are not tense and do not resist the pain. The more you resist this pain, the more you tense up, the more the pain increases.

So, the rule is: the more relaxed you are, the nicer these contractions will be. To help you understand how these contractions manifest, you will see that they resemble menstrual cramps. Now, menstrual cramps used to last a day, two, or three, and you had to take medication because you probably couldn’t handle them. Know that menstrual pain is not normal and is just a denial of your femininity. Either it is transmitted transgenerationally, or indeed, your parents wanted a boy and you were a girl. So, you somehow denied your femininity, and that’s where your menstrual pain comes from. But these pains last only a few seconds—twenty, thirty seconds—at fairly long intervals. So, I say you can handle them easily, because there’s no reason you can’t.

Now, let’s talk about the expulsion contractions, where the cervix is already fully dilated and the baby’s head has entered and slid gently into the vagina. We are talking about the second part of the birth canal, which consists of the descent and sliding of the baby into the vaginal canal. This gentle descent, millimeter by millimeter, triggers the expulsion contractions. This is the second phase: the first phase is the dilation of the cervix, after which, once the cervix is open, the baby slides into the vagina. The baby’s body will descend very smoothly, effectively massaging, millimeter by millimeter, with a gentle back-and-forth motion, every centimeter of the mother’s vaginal canal, which opens easily.

Now I will explain why this massage is millimeter by millimeter, in a back-and-forth motion. It’s as if you have a crab that takes two steps forward, then one step back and stops. The next contraction comes: two steps forward, one step back, and the contraction stops. What happens? Very simply, when I have a contraction, the longitudinal muscles of the uterus pull upward and push the baby during the contraction, then, when the contraction passes, the baby moves back, meaning it is pushed back. After the contraction ends, there is a recoil, a backward movement. It’s exactly that step back: two millimeters forward, one millimeter back, pause, two millimeters forward, one millimeter back. What does this mean? Well, two millimeters forward, one back. A progressive massage that effectively widens the canal ahead of the baby, who enters millimeter by millimeter and massages.

The fontanelles—I showed you somewhere here what a baby’s skull looks like. The fontanelles are those parts that are not yet fused, and when the baby slides into the mother’s vagina, the fontanelles overlap. That is, these are the fontanelles. Here, they are not fused together. When the baby enters the vagina and things get tight, the fontanelles overlap and create a smaller circumference of the head. That’s why, it’s pointless for someone to measure the baby’s head circumference during pregnancy, because when the baby enters the vagina and needs to squeeze through, the fontanelles will overlap and create a much smaller head circumference than when the fontanelles were not overlapping and the baby’s skull was at its normal size. That’s why these fontanelles reduce the head circumference, precisely because this part, for example, slides under the larger part. And here, the same: this back part passes underneath, and it’s as if the baby’s head is no longer as wide, but narrows.

This is to help you understand that not only is your body perfectly prepared for birth, but your baby is also perfectly prepared for birth. Now, let’s look at a vagina from the inside. Here we have the entrance to the vagina, and do you see these folds? It is very wrinkled. Here is the cervix. All these folds are there to allow stretching. So, the vagina is wrinkled enough to stretch as much as needed for a baby to pass through. Now, how does your vagina prepare for birth? First, I want to tell you that a few weeks before birth, you will have a more abundant vaginal discharge, which is not an infection, not a problem, you haven’t contracted any disease—your vagina is simply lubricating excessively. Why?

Let me ask you: how would it be to go to a water park and slide down a long slide without the water jet that propels you? If it’s just wet, you might feel that you don’t slide as well as when there’s a water jet and you go down with it. The same thing happens in the vagina. The vagina lubricates heavily to prepare the water slide for the baby. Plus, the baby descends with amniotic fluid and will come with water. Plus, the vagina is lubricated and slippery enough to allow for less friction. That means you won’t get irritated because it’s lubricated. The baby will slide very easily because it’s oiled beforehand, right? So, that more abundant discharge before birth only confirms that your vagina is preparing and is perfectly capable for this passage, meaning the expulsion of the baby.

What you see here is just a rose. I thought it was a beautiful image to illustrate how beautiful a vagina looks as it prepares for birth and becomes highly vascularized before and during birth. So, there is another element that makes it even friendlier for the baby: the fact that the vagina becomes highly vascularized before and during birth facilitates faster and better stretching of the entire skin and tissue. So, the tissues—the inside of the vagina—being very well vascularized, become more flexible and stretch more easily because they are full of blood. The less vascularized a tissue is, the more prone it is to tearing. That’s why, you see, your vagina knows it needs to become highly vascularized so the baby can pass very easily, without problems, through the vagina and perineum and so on. Thus, the vaginal walls become more elastic and stretch more easily. So, your vagina is perfectly built for birth and prepares for birth.

Now, if the vagina becomes highly vascularized, it changes color. So, the labia, which until now may have been pink or whatever color—you know better if you look with a mirror or your partner tells you—now, suddenly, the vaginal area, the vulva, becomes dark brown. It’s as if it turns black. And not only does the vulva and perineum darken due to excessive vascularization, but the nipples also darken. This, by the way, is so you understand why. Because these are the areas you will use most in the coming period. And for the baby who is born, the fact that the nipples darken will help them find their way to the breast, their source of food, more quickly. Very beautiful, right? So, the vulva darkens, the perineum darkens. You can see it with the naked eye. Men will even be fascinated: “Wow, they’re black or dark brown?” That’s exactly how the nipples darken too.

Good. What do we see here? A drawing. (laughs) You’d think it’s a grinder or something, but this is the vaginal canal. I’m showing it to you like this so you can understand a bit how everything happens. Closely connected and very close to the vagina is the bladder. The urethra is on the edge of the vagina. Here we have some ligaments and muscles that hold everything in place. And look again, the vagina, the vaginal canal, how wrinkled it is and how well it knows how to open, right? So, the vagina is perfectly built to stretch exactly as much as the baby needs to pass through.

And one more thing the vagina does to help you during birth. When the baby’s head enters the vagina, the pressure that the head and body of the baby exert gradually, millimeter by millimeter, two steps forward, one step back, that progressive massage, due to the pressure—because the baby is a bit larger—will numb the vaginal walls, which helps anesthetize the sensations. That’s why, when a woman is not rushed and experiences birth at her own pace, she will not feel pain, but pressure. So, when the baby is in your vagina, you will feel tremendous pressure, not necessarily pain. The painful moments are those when, during a contraction, the baby advances—those two steps forward, one step back. Then you may feel more than just pressure, a slight pain, because the baby descends slowly and makes room. But otherwise, when the contraction relaxes and there is a pause between contractions, in those moments the woman feels no discomfort, no pain, just the pressure—the pressure of the baby’s body in the vagina.

So, very simply, you see how the baby knows that the vagina is welcoming and that it will pass through, and everything aligns for the smoothest and quickest transition into the world. Now, I’ve put up a picture. Speaking of socks, how do we put on long socks? Do we leave them long and stick our foot in, thinking it will go all the way? Or do we roll the sock and put our foot in, then gradually pull the sock up? Everyone gets what I mean. It’s exactly the same with the vagina. The baby doesn’t shoot through and burst out of the vagina; the baby progresses gradually, unrolling, so to speak, and reaching into that sock, that vagina, progressively. No one passes through the vagina like lightning. (laughs) Right? The baby isn’t Superman to come out like that through the vagina. The baby slides through the vagina, gently pushed by each contraction, millimeter by millimeter, lower and lower. The vagina is perfectly elastic, built to stretch exactly as needed. It’s just like with a sock: when you put on a sock, you roll it millimeter by millimeter over your foot, not shove your whole foot in at once like a fool (laughs). Because everyone knows it’s not efficient to shove your foot in directly and expect to be fully socked in one go. So, it’s all logic, it’s all physiology. The baby is perfectly made to come out that way.

Now, here we have several types of vulvas—smaller, longer, fleshier, thinner, however you want to call them. The idea is that, regardless of what kind of vagina you have, your baby is capable of passing through, and your vagina is capable of stretching. No vagina was designed incorrectly so as not to allow a baby to pass. So, through this millimeter-by-millimeter sliding, at the pace of each contraction, the baby opens the vaginal canal and gently and slowly widens the vulva. That’s why birth has never been a one-and-done thing. If we had to go through birth without any pause, from the first contraction to the last, with no break and the baby had to pass through, we couldn’t handle it. That’s why labor is fragmented. It’s a fragmented process, made up of many moments when the baby advances, but also many moments and pauses between those moments. So, we have a contraction, let’s say, every fifteen minutes. Then a contraction every ten minutes. Then an expulsion contraction every three minutes, two minutes, one minute. But that means that between contractions there is a one-minute pause or a thirty-second pause. Moments when the woman catches her breath and can handle the intensity. So, I repeat, labor is a fragmented process, with many intense but short moments, because otherwise we couldn’t handle it and wouldn’t be able to give birth. But the fact that it’s fragmented and broken into many moments, with pauses in between, means we can handle the process without any problem.

Just think: if birth were such a difficult and frightening process… I’m not talking about this century, but before as well. We would have died out as a species. No woman would have wanted to give birth. Now, all women give birth by cesarean because no one teaches them about physiology anymore. They weren’t taught before either. But now we have the freedom to choose. And when we think, “Oh my, I can choose, so I won’t choose to suffer.” But she thinks this suffering is because it’s supposed to be that way. But no. The suffering is for other reasons. A woman who suffers during birth is a woman whose labor was induced, whose labor was forced, who was given animal oxytocin to speed things up. And when you rush this rhythm, it becomes unbearable. That’s why we must let the body follow its own rhythm. Because that’s what you can handle, and the rhythm is set by the baby and the mother’s hormones. Because the baby says, “I want a contraction!” The mother produces oxytocin, has a contraction. The baby triggers the next contraction. The same mechanism. So, the collaboration between the two—that magical dance between the baby asking, the mother responding, the baby asking, the mother giving—yes? That magical dance between the two is the rhythm of your contractions, depending on how your body reacts, that’s how labor works and continues.

Now, any woman can give birth vaginally. In the image, you have all possible and impossible types of vaginas and vulvas—it doesn’t matter. The idea is that there is no vagina that is too small, too tight, too long, too short, too narrow, or too large. There is no such thing. However, a woman who has an unresolved sexual blockage from childhood or adulthood, then the vaginal canal becomes impenetrable. Why? That sexual blockage, that abuse, that rape triggered in her brain and body a blockage that no longer allows anything to enter or exit. And yes, I have met many women who, because of childhood or youth rape, were blocked during birth and ended up having a cesarean because they hadn’t resolved this conflict earlier. And yes, it resulted in a concrete blockage. The baby was literally stuck in the vagina and could not come out, because the body does not forget. By the way, as I’ve said in all these days, in all my courses, the complications that arise during birth are just unresolved issues from childhood, adolescence, youth, or even from your own birth. So, birth blockages are all emotionally based.

So, if you know there was a story in your family of sexual abuse, rape, or abuse involving these organs, please heal them, because you will pass them on. And maybe you will get away with this birth. Maybe you’ll avoid a cesarean. But your child, whether a boy or a girl, will carry it on. It’s like a curse that someone eventually has to resolve, and you can resolve it by healing. Then you won’t pass it on to future generations. And I am absolutely convinced that anything can be healed, because I have healed things I never thought I could heal, including rape and sexual abuse. So, it works. The important thing is to realize it and bring it out into the open. It doesn’t mean we have to write in the newspaper who experienced what. The important thing is to remove them from that aura of secrecy, because family secrets are the worst. They come up at the most important moments in your life. And they can ruin a birth, a sex life, a relationship. Not just one—maybe many others. So, please, resolve these things. Contact me. Come to the birth healing course and I guarantee you will integrate this incest, rape, abuse, whatever it was, differently.

So, there is no vagina that is too small, too tight, too long, too short, too narrow, or too large. Any woman can give birth vaginally. There are no contraindications except emotional ones if you have a blockage.

Now, do you like this image? This is not how birth happens. This is not birth. It’s as if someone is torturing a woman. Can you imagine how this woman feels surrounded by so many doctors? And it wasn’t a complicated birth. This is what happens. It’s like a show. This is not how birth happens. No woman gives birth lying on her back by choice. All women who give birth choose gravity-assisted positions because… No one gives birth like this unless forced. A woman who is not forced will always choose gravity-assisted positions during labor and birth. So, no woman chooses to lie on her back and be handled or to struggle for hours to push a baby upward instead of using gravity. Why a gravity-assisted posture? For a smoother and easier birth, without extra effort. And yes, the baby comes out much faster and the woman doesn’t struggle as much if she is on all fours, standing, leaning, or kneeling. There are many options. And believe me, I would never give birth on my back again, because I’ve been through it and I don’t want to anymore. It was the most horrible experience, and when I gave birth to my second child standing up, it was a difference like heaven and earth. On a scale from zero to ten—where at my first birth the pain was like death and I rated it at thirteen, not ten, which was the maximum—at the second birth, the pain, because of the position I changed (I didn’t give birth on my back, but kneeling and standing), on a scale from zero to ten, ten being the most intense, I felt a one, two, or three. And believe me, you’re talking to me, and I am a coward. I am afraid of pain. I am not resistant to pain and I avoid pain because I don’t like it. I cry, I make a scene, I don’t accept it. That’s why I say, I would give birth to eleven more children. The problem is I wouldn’t have the availability to raise them, because it’s hard. But to give birth, honestly, I would do it for you. But you have to raise them. But that doesn’t work either, because you get attached and you can’t. That’s why I say, enjoy birth, because you receive all the information so you can have a beautiful, not traumatic, birth. So, I’ll see you at the next course, where we’ll learn about how the mother’s pelvis works and how the baby can pass through without problems. Thank you.
