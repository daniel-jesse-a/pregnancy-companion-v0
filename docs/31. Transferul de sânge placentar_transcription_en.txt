Warm greetings to you, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you again for a course about the placenta and placental blood transfer. Today, I will talk to you about the circulation of blood from the placenta to the baby. The same process also happens in reverse. I will tell you about the increase in placental weight up to birth. We will discuss how much blood the placenta contains and circulates during and after pregnancy. I will also explain how many milliliters of blood are in the baby’s body in the womb. We will talk about placental blood after birth and about the pulsation of the umbilical cord. How long does it last? About umbilical cord clamping as a standard procedure and what disadvantages it has. And yes, I will show you how much blood remains in the sanctuFactory if it is clamped in the first thirty seconds. We will also talk about iron-deficiency anemia and cord clamping. And you will see the difference between cutting the umbilical cord after birth and before the pulsation ends.

So, let’s begin the lesson about placental blood transfer, meaning the blood that is transferred from the placenta to the baby, precisely to help the baby have a good start in this life, outside the mother’s womb. The circulation of blood from the placenta to the baby flows in this direction, from the placenta to the baby, through the umbilical cord and to the baby’s organs, starting from the navel area, because that is where the umbilical cord attaches. This blood, which starts from the placenta toward the baby, is oxygenated blood that carries oxygen and nutrients to the baby, through the navel, to the vital organs and to the brain. Then, at the same rhythm, the residual blood circulates from the baby’s body, through the umbilical cord, back to the placenta. So, the residues that the baby does not eliminate are sent back into the bloodstream, to the placenta, through the umbilical cord, and from the placenta onward, they are taken up by the mother’s circulatory system. So, there is a constant back-and-forth between the placenta, which is the baby’s external organ, and the baby in the womb. This external organ of the baby in the womb is just an external organ, which will survive for about thirty minutes after birth, after which it completes its task and detaches. So, the placenta will detach about half an hour after birth and will finish its role of oxygenation, nourishment, and waste processing.

The placenta is an absolutely miraculous organ, which indeed grows along with the baby. In the first trimester, the placenta develops but is not functional, because the baby is still nourished from the yolk sac, like a kind of yolk, as with chicks. Until then, the placenta develops, and from about the eighteenth week it becomes functional—eighteen weeks of pregnancy—and will nourish and oxygenate the baby. So, the placenta grows along with the baby’s weight gain, because it helps the baby grow. A placenta can weigh up to about 1.5 pounds (700 grams) at birth, so it fits in two outstretched palms and will serve to nourish, oxygenate, and process waste during pregnancy. You see, it looks like a tree—the Tree of Life, as it is called—because it grows, oxygenates, and nourishes our baby while in the womb.

Did you know that the placenta always contains about a third of the baby’s blood, approximately 5 ounces (150 milliliters)? So, throughout the time the baby is in the womb, the placenta will have about 5 ounces, and the baby’s body about 10 ounces (300 milliliters). So, 5 plus 10 ounces. At birth, the baby will have about 15 ounces (450 milliliters) of blood in a body about 20 inches (50 centimeters) long and, who knows, about 7.7 pounds (3.5 kilograms). The remaining 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood are in the baby’s body and will continuously circulate between the placenta and the body. There is a constant circulation. Part of the blood goes to oxygenate and nourish the body, the other part brings back blood full of residues to the placenta. So, the placenta has a dual role: nourishment and oxygenation, and waste processing. What does the placenta do with the residues not processed by the baby? It passes them to the mother. So, dear mother or future mother, in fact, you are already a mom. Please take care of yourself, because you don’t need to eat for two, as the placenta takes care of your baby. But I would like you to drink water for two people. Why? Because all the residues you need to process, since you take them from the placenta, you will have to eliminate from your body. So, your liver and kidneys will work double. Therefore, you need to increase your water intake to be able to eliminate the extra residues you have from the baby, in addition to your own.

As I mentioned earlier, blood flows continuously between the fetus and the placenta during pregnancy. Here, in image A, we have the placenta actually sending oxygenated blood through that thick, red vein directly to the navel and then to the lungs, heart, liver, and so on, and then throughout the body. The two arteries, which are smaller and pink, also start from the navel and collect residual blood and all the toxins that the baby, since the liver is not yet functional, brings and transports to the placenta. By the way, the liver, stomach, and lungs will activate after birth, when the placenta completes its role. So, the baby does not digest anything through the stomach. The baby does not metabolize anything through the liver. Toxins are sent to the placenta and to the mother, and the lungs do not function during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the lungs are filled with a fluid similar to gastric fluid, but it is not amniotic fluid. So, even if the baby swallows amniotic fluid, which is the fluid the baby is in, it will not inhale it, because the lungs are filled with that fluid which does not mix. Then, before birth, as the baby passes through the vaginal canal, the shoulders compress and expel that fluid through the nose and mouth, after which the lungs are free for the first inhalation of air, which happens when the nose and mouth touch air for the first time.

So, during pregnancy, the diaphragm, which divides the abdomen in two and is located just below the lungs, makes an up-and-down movement. This means it mimics inhalation and exhalation. This trains the lungs to develop and perform the same inhalation-exhalation movement when the baby is ready for the first breath after birth. Between the baby in the womb and the placenta, there is a constant pulsation through the umbilical cord, which sends and receives blood in both directions. This constant pulsation through the umbilical cord helps the baby receive nutrients and oxygen to develop and send residues back to the placenta for the mother to process further. So, this pulsation of the umbilical cord is continuous and in both directions throughout pregnancy. The amount of blood circulated between the baby and the placenta is about 15 ounces (450 milliliters). This blood is in constant motion between the placenta and the baby during pregnancy. Of course, it is not always 15 ounces, because if the baby is only six months old, it will not yet have that amount of blood. The 15 ounces are reached approximately at birth. But this is self-explanatory. The baby is not full of blood when very small, so the amount of blood at the beginning and end of pregnancy is not the same. Obviously.

Immediately after birth, the placenta will pulse blood in only one direction, toward the newborn’s body, through that thick vein. In fact, everything in the vein and the two arteries will pulse not only the blood in the placenta, those 5 ounces (150 ml), but also stem cells. Because stem cells have the role of repairing any problems that occurred during birth. That is why nature has designed us so intelligently that these stem cells are added only after birth, not before, because after birth they repair any, let’s say, damage that happened due to the intensity of birth. As you see in this picture, the baby at first is purple. Please do not be alarmed. All babies, when transitioning from an intrauterine environment in amniotic fluid to an extrauterine environment, meaning outside the uterus, in air, their skin, when they take their first breath, will turn purple, then pink, and then a normal color, close to ours, maybe a bit more reddish. So, it is absolutely normal for the baby’s skin to be purple in the first two minutes after birth. Do not worry, there is no danger, because I know many mothers who were frightened by their own mothers when told, “Oh, you were so purple at birth!” Yes, we were all purple, but not everyone noticed, and some gave this purple a wrong connotation. Purple is normal. What’s important is that after two minutes, the purple turns pink. But it happens automatically, simply due to different oxygenation.

At birth, the placenta contains about 5 ounces (150 ml) of blood, which will be transferred in the first 25 minutes into the newborn’s body. What you see here is a picture of a placenta with a very cute umbilical cord, which even has “Love” written on it. This image clearly shows that after the pulsation ends, nothing else happens. The cord remains white and flaccid and begins to dry, as is natural. If the cord is clamped in the first seconds of life, the placenta remains full of the baby’s rightful blood, and the newborn’s body will suffer this loss of about 5 ounces (150 ml). Not only does the placenta keep the baby’s rightful blood when clamped, but also the vital stem cells remain trapped there, so important for a newborn. What does a lack of 5 ounces (150 ml) mean for a baby? Iron-deficiency anemia and lack of plasma. Here you see the total 15 ounces (450 ml), of which 10 ounces (300 ml) or 5 ounces (150 ml) are always in the baby’s body and in the placenta. All these deficiencies cannot be corrected by any synthetic or natural supplement, nor even by breastfeeding for a year and a half. To prevent this iron-deficiency anemia, you simply need to allow and respect the pulsation of the umbilical cord. Here you see how vascularized an umbilical cord is in the first 20 or 25 minutes after birth. Respect this deep vascularization and let the plasma and stem cells enter your baby’s body. They belong to the baby. You have no right to do anything with them.

Here you can see how the umbilical cord starts to become more and more flaccid. The baby probably already has a few minutes after birth. And here we see a completely white umbilical cord, with no trace of blood in it. The baby is already at the mother’s chest. And the difference between a newborn with anemia, who is the first, and one without anemia. These children, even though they are the same, are twins, of the same mother, but were born differently. The first had the umbilical cord cut in the first seconds of life, while the second, being the second, had the cord left to pulse and you can see it has a different color than the first, who, poor thing, remained rather pale.

See you at the next lesson with great pleasure! I wish you a wonderful day!
