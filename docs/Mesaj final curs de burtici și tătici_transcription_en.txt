My dear, congratulations on making it to the end of this course. Please know that this course only covers the basic information—the essentials that I felt you absolutely needed to know before your baby is born. However, even though there is quite a lot of information here, and you have spent many hours with me, taking notes, this is not everything you could possibly learn about childbirth. I have a ton of additional videos and courses that I recommend. So you have the option to delve deeper into any topic that interests you most.

For example, maybe you want to use breathing techniques during labor. Perhaps you want to minimize the pain you feel during labor contractions and would like to learn specific breathing methods for contractions and, at the end, a different breathing technique for the pushing stage. Maybe you need to understand how your body behaves during the pushing phase. Or here’s another very important thing: maybe you want to know what the standard procedures are in a hospital or maternity ward. Maybe you don’t know how to fill out your birth plan. By the way, you can find it among the free materials you can download and print. If you need help completing it, I have a nearly four-hour course where you can do this together with me, so you know your rights during childbirth.

So yes, there is still much to do, but the main thing is that you have learned a lot with this basic course. Plus, I have a bonus for you. You’ll see that there are some videos I really want you to watch several times, where I explain contractions, how the uterus works, and I talk about many things to make your birth experience easier. Of course, you can choose them individually if you want to learn more about ultrasounds and how beneficial or harmful they are for your baby in the womb. Or, yes, you can get all this information and purchase the entire package I have prepared for you, including the live online course with me, where we will go into detail about your birth experience, your partner’s birth experience, and how your own births can influence your child’s birth.

Again, because many people, even if they are physically and informationally prepared, still have emotional aspects and bodily responses related to birth—specifically, the limbic imprint—which are often untouched. That’s why you can choose any package you wish to purchase. And yes, in those packages, especially the live one with me, we will address healing your own birth and childhood traumas. And not only that. We will also discuss the topic of limbic imprint, which I mentioned earlier. We will watch films and documentaries about birth. You will see how birth can happen and how beautiful it can be. You will not see the screaming and shouting you see on TV, because those are shown that way for ratings. And yes, we will watch films about what a baby wants when they are born, what a baby wants in the mother’s womb, and what they want from their parents.

Not only will you watch these films together with your partner—films you can’t find elsewhere—but we will also discuss them together and see what memories they stir in you, what kind of memories they awaken, and what unconscious memories lie beneath our forgetfulness. Forgetfulness, because we don’t remember how we were born and we don’t remember the period up to two and a half or three years old.

So, I am now leaving you a surprise video, with a collage and some questions to help you understand that behind the information you have just received, there is still quite a bit of work to do with our own childhood and birth memories.

Therefore, if you choose to continue healing your own birth and your partner’s birth, so you can beautifully welcome your child’s birth, you will also have access to a WhatsApp group where we will stay connected and keep in touch even after the course ends. And yes, during the live online course with me, you will be able to ask countless questions until you truly have no more questions left. I promise you that.

You can find details about all these offers I briefly mentioned in the description below. I am now leaving you the video and I wish you a birth experience exactly as you desire—beautiful and fulfilling. And remember, I am here if you need more information, healing, or simply some advice. Thank you so much! I send you a warm embrace!
