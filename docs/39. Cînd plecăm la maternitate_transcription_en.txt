Hello, my dear! I am Ditta Depner and... this is a very important course. I believe it is the most important in terms of knowledge for you and your partner, whom I recommend should be by your side during this course, because in this course I will present to you the exact signs that indicate the onset of labor. You know, the greatest fear for men is not knowing when labor starts, being afraid it might be too late, that you might get to the hospital too late, or that you might give birth in the car. By the way, if he has attended the recorded course so far, this fear of "Wow, what do I do if my partner gives birth in the car?" almost completely disappears. But it is very important for both of you to know exactly what the signs of labor onset are. Because, in the end, these are the most important things I teach. Because they help you to be calm and to confidently await the arrival of your baby. In fact, the approach of your baby's birth day.

What will I tell you in this course? First of all, this course is based on the many years of experience I have accumulated. Not only from the perspective of a woman giving birth, but also from the perspective of a midwife assisting a birth or a doula accompanying a pregnant woman during birth. And these signs are not the ones you will find in medical or obstetrics textbooks. You won’t find them in courses about when labor starts either. This course about the signs of labor onset has nothing to do with what you have read on the internet, about minutes, how many minutes apart contractions should be, how many signs you will see and feel... No, it’s about something else. It’s about some secrets that only experienced midwives and doctors know, those who have observed births rather than intervened to speed them up. These are signs that are very little known, especially since here, birth is no longer left to unfold naturally, but is hurried, forced, provoked, and so on.

So, let’s see what is the moment of meeting your baby, and especially, how to know that this moment is approaching. I will give you a list of the distinct signs that your baby is preparing for birth, because, by the way, the baby initiates labor, and at the same time, your body is preparing for birth. If you have followed the other courses in the recommended order, please make sure you also watch the course about contractions, about the cervix, about the vagina, and about your pelvis, so you can understand physiologically what is happening, so you can assimilate this information, which is somewhat more advanced than the basics. And we will talk about the mucus plug. What does it mean? There is also a course about the mucus plug. We will talk about physiology, about what it looks like, what you should know, what it means. We will talk about unexpected physiological needs, about what the maternity bag should contain.

And this is very important, because many women buy dozens of unnecessary things. Besides costing a lot of money, they are useless and will end up in the baby’s crib, which is just another piece of furniture, filled with things you won’t use. Because if you have watched my videos, you have realized that your baby’s place is in your bed, not in a crib or stroller, but next to you, close to you. I will tell you about all the physical symptoms that will show you that labor is starting soon. We will talk about the rupture or fissure of the membranes. We will talk about what the membranes should look like, what the amniotic fluid should look like, how to recognize if there is a problem with the amniotic fluid. We will talk about uterine contractions, their role, timing, how often they occur, how these contractions feel in your body.

I will tell you about the types of contractions, because there are several types. How to recognize them? How to categorize them? There are many questions, I know you have them. And I will reveal the secret of how to know you have reached 7 centimeters dilation without a vaginal exam or anyone measuring your dilation. And another secret, I will tell you how to know you have reached full dilation, again without vaginal exams or other checks. We will also talk about the plateau phase, which is very rare but does exist, so you know how to manage a plateau phase and not only how to manage it, but also how to overcome it correctly and without interfering with labor. And we will talk about the moment of expulsion and victory, when the baby lands in your and your partner’s arms.

So, this is a very important course. That’s why, please, besides taking notes, go and get your partner and come to the course, because this is some of the most important information you will receive, because after this information, you will be together, you will be a team, and you will know what to do at every moment of labor.

Let’s begin! Signs of labor onset. So the big moment of meeting your baby is approaching. What do you need to know about your body? What you haven’t learned during pregnancy and what changes now, before birth, and your body is the witness. What are the distinct signs that labor is approaching? Do you know them? Besides your belly growing, besides counting weeks or months, besides someone telling you a probable due date, there are many other signs that show and indicate that labor is approaching. Let’s see what they are.

The first distinct sign that labor is approaching. Let’s see what it is. Haha, you’re pregnant! Of course you will give birth. This is the most obvious sign that labor is approaching. From the first day you took the test, you knew that birth would follow. That’s my little joke. The fact that you’re pregnant is the first sign that the baby will come. But yes, let’s see what the first real distinct sign is that labor is approaching: the loss of the mucus plug. What you see in the image is a mucus plug which acts as a uterine seal, sealing the uterus. It is located at the cervix, where the gateway is, the cervix which is theoretically closed most of the time, but sometimes opens, and in this space, the mucus plug or uterine seal forms. It can have many forms and can look like this as well. So I want you to look carefully, so you don’t get scared if you find these signs on paper or in your underwear that you have lost the mucus plug. By the way, the mucus plug can be lost even during pregnancy. No problem, it regenerates. So this seal that protects the baby from unwanted infections—though it’s unlikely for infections to reach the uterus, especially since the baby is in its amniotic sac—this uterine seal can be lost several times during pregnancy, because the movement and position of the cervix change depending on the woman’s emotional state. And please make sure to watch the course on breathing during expulsion, because there I explain what to do to have an easy birth.

And I also suggest you watch the video about the cervix, because there you will find a lot of information about how the cervix changes its position and behavior—since I always say it’s a living organ—how it changes its behavior depending on the woman’s emotional state. I explain it much better there.

So I found a few more pictures here where you can see what a mucus plug might look like. It can also be pinkish or bloody, yes, or brownish. This is the uterine seal that is eliminated, sometimes without you even realizing it. For example, at none of my births do I remember the mucus plug, because I didn’t see it. It probably came out when I went to the bathroom and I didn’t notice, but I didn’t find it. So this is a sign that can appear or can go unnoticed.

Now, depending on when you lose this mucus plug, you shouldn’t panic. For example, if you lose it during pregnancy, that doesn’t mean, “Oh no, I’m giving birth, panic!” No! The cervix may be dilated and then the plug can no longer stay in place, because if the cervix shortens and begins to dilate, the plug that was between the walls of the cervix has no support and you will lose it. But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “Oh my, labor is starting!” If it’s before labor, two or three weeks before, again, you see, we don’t have a certain date. Labor cannot be predicted. You can’t know when you will give birth. You can guess, you can... You can schedule it, yes, if you want, but then you are interfering a lot with the child’s free will and their right to choose their birth day, not just when you want...

So, the idea is that when you lose the mucus plug, it can still take up to two or three weeks before you give birth. But yes, it is a sign, it is a sign that it’s approaching.

Good, let’s see another distinct sign that labor is starting soon. It is one of the signs that doesn’t keep you waiting, it is present, it’s not just your imagination: going to the bathroom for a sudden bowel movement. A pregnant woman awaiting labor who suddenly needs to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement, this is clearly a sign that labor is starting. Why? Well, very simply. Physiologically, when we start an important action that involves certain organs and not others, the body focuses on that process. During labor, the body will focus on labor, not digestion.

It’s like during an exam. If you ever had a tough exam and went to college or school, and before the exam, when you were very nervous, do you remember how there was a line at the bathroom? It happened to all of us. Why? The body goes into a mode, I don’t know what to call it, “five is life.” When we got a five, we were happy. Some were happy with a ten. Depends on what college you went to—I went to college for my parents, so I didn’t care about grades, just to pass. So, when I was nervous for an exam and just wanted to pass, no matter how or with what grade, I got so nervous that my body went into “five is life” mode. Meaning, let’s just get a passing grade, and what needed to be activated? Digestion? Not at all, because digestion doesn’t help me pass the exam, but activating the brain does.

So, I would empty my digestive tract of everything digested, undigested, barely swallowed, and get rid of everything. Why? Because in moments like these, the body reserves energy only for what is important. And then digestion is not on the list of important things. The same with labor. The same when you see a bear, yes, digestion is not important. When you see a bear, most people soil themselves out of fear. Why? Because the body goes into fight, flight, or freeze mode. Yes, these are automatic responses. So when the body goes into flight mode—let’s save ourselves, the bear is coming, we’re fighting or running—it gets rid of everything in the digestive tract to make running easier and faster, without carrying extra weight. So it empties the digestive tract of everything digested or undigested. That’s exactly what happens during labor.

Why did I give you all these comparisons? So you understand that it’s all very logical. Our body is logical, it’s predictable. But only if you know. If you don’t know, you might think, “Oh no, I must have eaten something bad.” No, you didn’t eat anything bad and you don’t have a stomach problem, it’s just that going to the bathroom for a sudden bowel movement is one of the distinct signs that labor is starting soon. So, pay attention! Many women, even after attending the course and learning this, are still surprised. Why does this happen? And they can hardly believe that when it happens and they empty their bowels, it really means labor is starting.

And usually, that’s exactly what happens. And at the end, they say, “Wow, I didn’t think the sign was so distinct, because when it happened, I thought I had a stomach problem.” No, you didn’t have a stomach problem. It’s a clear sign that labor is starting. Good, so it’s a distinct sign. You can’t miss it. For example, if you plan to leave the city where you live and go to another city, because unfortunately, only there can you have a gentle birth, a birth plan, a water birth, or a respectful birth, it’s worth paying attention to these signs, because this first sign can indicate very well when to leave for that place. So, from the moment it happens, after you get up, you take your bags and go. Speaking of bags, have you packed your maternity bag? Well, it’s time to have it ready. That’s why I recommend you take a small suitcase, one of those you can take on a plane, about 22 pounds, you don’t need more. Anyway, you won’t need many baby clothes, because clothes are unnecessary, since in the first three or four days you’ll be in the hospital, two or three days, the baby will be glued to you and will need maybe just a diaper and a onesie. But you’ll see and realize that I made a list for the maternity bag and more important are other things than the baby’s clothes. And certainly not little shoes and certainly not a bottle. So this is a picture with examples of those. You don’t need this, or this, or this. And not some special hoodie or hairbrush. You’ll need those more at home, not there. Because, honestly, in the first two or three days after the baby is born, the child needs nothing but the arms of the mother and father and to be with them non-stop. What you will need is definitely a baby carrier, because that’s how you’ll go home with the baby, in a carrier and not in bassinets and all sorts of cribs and devices. And not in a car seat either.

Because close to you, the baby can travel anywhere without being afraid of losing you or losing physical contact with you. Because birth, if you look at it this way, is the greatest rupture that happens between mother and child. And the child is desperate because they know that without the mother, they won’t survive. Which is true. Because a child, up to a certain age, without a mother or help, won’t survive—it’s a matter of life and death. So, for the child, the experience of birth and separation from the mother can be the trauma of their life. That’s why I ask you to also watch the course on the “golden hour,” to understand what expectations and physiological and emotional needs the child has from the moment they are born until they start to detach from the mother gradually. That’s later, when they start walking and increase their distance from the parent. But until then, the child is, how should I say, like a kangaroo, yes? The mother should carry her child, and the child needs the mother like air. The child is not born to become solitary or to sleep in their own crib or room. Those are societal myths that don’t work. The fact that some succeed in training their child to cope doesn’t mean there weren’t serious traumas left, which will be reflected in their relationships, life, character, personality, way of interacting, insecurity, and fear of being abandoned again.

So here I made quite a broad incursion into human psychology, but the maternity bag is quite simple. And here I made you an actual list of what you need to have in your maternity bag. And you’ll see that they are not things you’ll see in all sorts of videos from all sorts of women and mothers who made their maternity bag and were paid by all sorts of companies to sell diapers, clothes, cosmetics, and other things. I don’t care what you buy or from whom, what matters is to have the main and correct, useful things, not nonsense. Because you’ll see that going to baby fairs is the biggest nonsense and the best opportunity to spend tens of thousands of dollars for nothing. I’m very serious, because now any, let’s say, vehicle, yes, a baby stroller, can reach exorbitant amounts. As much as a small car. Good. Back to this, I know men will agree with me. Women, not so much, because we like shopping. But I tell you, I was advised the same and I still bought nonsense because I didn’t believe I would need as few things as an informed mother told me.

So, you need three copies. Why do you have to share it at the hospital? And by the way, with the birth plan, you don’t go when you’re in labor. You go well in advance to discuss it. Because if they don’t respect or accept your birth plan, you’ll have to change hospitals, one, two, or five, until you find one that accepts your wishes, which are natural for a parent, yes? So you fill out the birth plan with what you agreed on beforehand and go to a place where you know it will be respected. Don’t go randomly, because it’s quite risky to be left out, meaning to be ignored.

What else you need are your original documents. Your original documents mean your ID, marriage certificate. If you don’t have one, you need your birth certificates. You’ll need these in original. This is required at city hall when you register your child, yes? Then, if you have medical records from the pregnancy, take them all and put them in a folder and present them, because very often there is an exaggeration with these medical records from pregnancy. But if you’ve already done them and now you’ve decided not to do more, those that show everything was fine and that a low-risk pregnancy doesn’t suddenly become risky are good.

Good, do you also need pillows? Pillows, why? Well, if you’re traveling by car, you’ll need pillows for support. Anyway, you won’t be sitting in the front seat. You might sit in the back. You’ll need the same pillows when you return with the newborn, because you’ll need nursing pillows to raise the baby to breast level. You’ll need pillows for your own comfort. You might not want to sit as if nothing happened—you just gave birth. I recommend you also pack some extra towels, some indispensable blankets for your comfort, because yes, sometimes your feet get cold or you need a blanket to feel better, more wrapped up, warmer, who knows. And towels, or those waterproof pads, are very good, because after birth, the woman enters the postpartum period, which means a kind of blood discharge, as the uterus cleans itself, which lasts quite a while, not just three or four days like a period, but a week, two, three, depending on how medicalized the birth was, because the more natural the birth, the shorter this cleaning period will be, even just a week, after which you won’t feel any discomfort.

Good. The essential oils kit with therapeutic grade oils. Be careful with oils, because many are synthetic and you don’t need anything synthetic now. I have prepared a maternity kit for mothers and babies, including for the golden hour, for “Welcome, baby!”, for mother’s exhaustion, for relaxation, for increasing contractions, for jaundice if the baby gets it. So it’s a small kit, a small investment. You don’t need to buy hundreds or dozens of oils to make your own mixes. Plus, these mixes were recommended by midwives and tested by me. And I have an oil for pain, especially for labor pain. Fantastic, it works wonders. I use it for other pains too and it’s great. The oil kit is also for eliminating fear. I have an oil for fear that reduces anxiety and helps you have an easy birth. Then, what else do I recommend in the maternity kit? Prepare some cotton compresses for your forehead, neck, and perineum, because I choose them in different colors so I know which is which. They are very good, especially during labor, when a woman feels the need for something cold on her forehead or pulse, or something warm on her forehead or chest, who knows. There are many states a woman in labor goes through and it will be much easier to help yourself with compresses that can be cold or warm at the same time. I also recommend you take a thermos for fruit juices or water. You are allowed to eat and drink. Make sure you have something. Yes, I still highly recommend plasma, Quinton plasma, taken as in a marathon. Because labor is like a marathon in terms of energy consumption. I recommend you take plasma every hour, because it revitalizes and remineralizes you instantly. It’s very important because women usually lose a lot of minerals during labor, through sweating and energy consumption.

Clothes and cosmetics for you and the baby. Perineal oil, also very important, nipple cream for breastfeeding. Diapers for the baby. I assume you don’t want to use diapers full of chemicals, like those from Pampers or other well-known brands, which are full of junk. Postpartum pads are very important to have. They are more special than regular period pads. Because they are much longer and thicker, as the discharge is different and not like a period. Underwear for before and after birth, because this is different from the normal underwear we wear when not pregnant. Postpartum panties, again, extremely important and practical, especially since you’ll spend the first month in bed with your baby, trying to sleep, trying to feed yourself in bed, breastfeeding, rocking, sleeping—the baby will be glued to you, especially in the first two months after birth. And I say this in the breastfeeding course and in other postpartum courses. Don’t forget your camera, video camera, mobile phone, headphones, all with batteries or chargers, because you’ll need them. Don’t forget them, prepare them all, put them in a suitcase, and keep the suitcase open so that when the first sign of labor appears, you throw everything in the same place, close the suitcase, and leave, because you need to free your mind for other things, not to keep your mind busy with packing.

The bag is there, ready, you just close the suitcase, throw in the last things, and leave. What you need is an elastic wrap for transporting the baby home at the mother’s chest from day one, even with mom in the back seat of the car. By the way, dear mothers, if you are drivers, when you carry your baby, forget about driving. You will need a driver, because you can’t drive and carry your baby at the same time. This information is vital, and the woman with the baby in a wrap or carrier will always sit in the back and put the seatbelt not over the baby, but without touching the baby. It’s possible. It’s simple. You also need hydrogen peroxide and pads, because even for home birth I recommend these pads, because they are waterproof and you can use them even if you didn’t give birth at home in bed. Because lying semi-reclined in the first two months, you might not want to stain the mattress. And I recommend you get a waterproof sheet to put over the mattress, then a normal cotton sheet, and then the pads, to be sure nothing happens. Yes? So it’s not that hard, but you definitely need special postpartum panties, which are special panties. They are very airy, meaning they have quite a wide coverage, but are somehow crocheted with very large holes—not with a crochet hook, but I don’t know how to call it. And they are for long-term use, meaning with a pack of about five pieces, you’ll manage for one birth and can keep them for the next child, if there is one. They are washable, so very practical, and get special postpartum pads, not others, because the others are not good and many are full of chemicals, chlorine, and you really don’t need to put something artificial and full of chemicals on your perineum after birth.
