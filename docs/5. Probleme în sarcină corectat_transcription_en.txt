Greetings, my dear! I am glad to see you here at this course about pregnancy issues. I am Dita Depner, and I want to tell you more today about what is forbidden during pregnancy, what is allowed, especially since there are so many discussions about what women are or are not allowed to do during pregnancy. Afterwards, I want to talk about the emotional causes that trigger unpleasant symptoms during pregnancy, especially since most of us believe that if we are pregnant, we must feel unwell. Then, we will discuss in more detail all the problems that can occur during pregnancy, but not necessarily because you must experience them: nausea, heartburn, vomiting, edema, back pain, muscle cramps or spasms, candidiasis, vaginal discharge, herpes, high and low blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, hemorrhoids, cystitis, and panic attacks. Please understand that you do not have to experience these just because you are pregnant; I just want to tell you about them so you understand where they come from and, if they do appear, you know what to do.

So, welcome to my recorded course about pregnancy issues—or “issues” in quotation marks. First, I will tell you what is forbidden during pregnancy, because these substances cross the placenta and reach your baby directly. Smoking, caffeine or theine—theine is exactly the equivalent of caffeine, found in tea—and cocoa, which is also a nervous system stimulant. Of course, alcohol is completely forbidden during pregnancy, as are drugs, medications, and narcotic substances. One more thing: be very careful with neurotoxins that cross the blood-brain barrier. Usually, these neurotoxins are found in medications, vaccines, injections, and other such things. So, pay close attention to these things, which are totally forbidden during pregnancy if you want a healthy child and to avoid complications.

Good. What are the actual causes of all the problems during pregnancy? And why do some women suffer while others enjoy their pregnancy? Well, first of all, I am not saying there is no suffering or that you should only be happy, but many women cause themselves suffering through negative thoughts about the baby, through worries—of course, worries often amplified by the medical system, which gives the pregnant woman the impression that she is ill. So, the causes of all problems during pregnancy are emotional in nature. The better a woman feels emotionally, the happier her pregnancy will be. The more worried she is during pregnancy, the more problems will keep appearing.

You know very well that the medical approach—because I assume you have already seen it—the modern medical approach to pregnancy is that the pregnant woman is ill. Therefore, her body must be investigated like a machine that needs obsessive servicing and over-analysis. It is not enough to go once and have some tests done; it is as if you are subscribing to tests. I do not know where this comes from, except that the only explanation is that it is a money-making factory. Otherwise, a pregnant woman is not ill just because she is carrying a baby. Of course, we must be more careful, more present, pay attention to our diet, and take better care of ourselves. But that still does not put us on the patient list. A pregnant woman is a woman carrying a pregnancy, but she is by no means ill.

Another thing: when we take a car to a service center, we usually do so because a warning light is flashing on the dashboard. We take the manual and look up what that symbol means. The manual says the flashing light corresponds to the oil that needs changing. So, you go to the service, tell them the light is flashing, and of course, you expect them to deal not with the light, but with the oil. You do not want them to just stop the light from flashing; you want them to address the cause that made the light flash—in this case, the oil change. Here is the difference: when we go to a car service, the people there deal with the cause of the warning light. But with people, at the “service,” we only deal with the warning lights. If a light flashes, we make the flashing stop. If I have a headache, we make the headache go away. If my stomach hurts, we make the stomach pain go away. But in reality, we do not address the cause that triggered the headache or stomach pain.

Of course, it is normal to want the pain to go away, but pain will not disappear if I do not address what triggered it. And here we already have the first problems. First, we do not have a user manual. Second, everyone gives us medications or pills that actually make the symptoms disappear, but do not address the cause. So, with modern allopathic medicine, in most cases, we cover up the symptoms—we make them disappear without addressing what triggered that symptom or discomfort or pain. This is where we need to intervene, because hiding or masking symptoms might eventually lead us to discover that our “machine” is seriously damaged, because we keep covering up and making symptoms disappear. But we do not do anything at a deep level, right? So, it seems machines are treated better than people. A person is not a machine, not a robot; you cannot just change parts. So, we need to look at the deep causes of these disturbing symptoms in pregnancy.

What does allopathic medicine do? As I said, the only solution for pregnancy problems is to give you pills, which usually have side effects. Of course, we do not even look at the leaflet anymore, because if the doctor gave it to us, we do not check the leaflet, and you will see that, at least in Romania, we have many medications prescribed during pregnancy that are actually contraindicated in pregnancy. Yes, probably everyone acts on their own responsibility, but I do not think that is a solution.

The causes of all problems in pregnancy, especially the emotional ones—because everything starts from them—are actually childhood memories. Yes, I know, it sounds like a story. It is not a story, because when a woman is pregnant, her vulnerability increases many times over. You already know this, because you have noticed that during pregnancy you are much more sensitive, much more vulnerable, not like you were before. All this vulnerability comes from the subconscious, because it throws us back into that phase, into childhood memories. These childhood memories can be conscious—those after two and a half, three years old, because from then on we know we can have memory of what happened. Some people do not remember, others do. And before two and a half years old, we only have conscious memory of very, very important events. But usually, people do not remember the period from birth to two and a half years old.

So, what happens during pregnancy? The woman becomes more vulnerable because both unconscious and conscious childhood memories are activated in her, plus how she experienced her own birth and early childhood up to two and a half, three years old. Who raised her? What events occurred? That is why there is a tumult of emotions when we are pregnant, and the most frequent emotional causes are reflected exactly in the state of the pregnant woman, and her state perfectly mirrors her opinion about herself during pregnancy. Then we have the conscious part—memories from childhood—and the third mechanism is what your subconscious mind knows about your own conception, about how your mother’s pregnancy was when you were a baby in the womb, how your birth was, and the first three years of your life. So, during pregnancy, a woman will involuntarily remember all these memories, whether they are conscious or unconscious. And all these memories will shape her opinion about pregnancy, from stories heard from her mother, from others, from other women, from friends.

That is why we need a lot of information and confidence to face these great vulnerabilities that occur precisely during pregnancy. So, the emotional conflicts created by the conscious and subconscious mind are the cause of all problems in pregnancy. That is why a woman, aware of her power to resolve and heal these traumas, will begin her most fascinating journey starting today. Because it is not enough to just prepare for birth; it is very important to resolve and heal, and to make peace with the conscious and unconscious memories from your childhood. So, it is not just about physical preparation, but also psychological and emotional preparation. This is actually the secret, and that is why my courses are quite long and very comprehensive and contain a lot of information, not just practical, but also about emotions, the subconscious, and everything that manifests in a pregnant woman during this period.

And now, as I was saying about the user manual, you should know that there are plenty of manuals for the human body, where you will find symptoms associated with emotional conflicts. Because your body is your most loyal friend in this life. You just have to listen to it, take the book, and start interpreting. I recommend you look for them. There are many international authors, books in Romanian, English, and other international languages, where you will find symptoms associated with the emotions that trigger them. From that moment, you can realize: “Ah, look, now this hurts. That means somewhere in my subconscious I have a conflict that is affecting my well-being and giving me these symptoms.” And then you will no longer run to the medicine cabinet to take a pill, because you are already pregnant and you know that most medications have side effects because they are synthetic. So, you will turn to the book to read and see what emotional causes are associated with your body’s symptoms. That is why I have prepared a list for you with things you should know, with symptoms you might encounter during pregnancy.

So, in conclusion, I want to tell you that all hidden and unexpressed emotions will manifest through unpleasant symptoms, precisely so you can heal them—definitely before your baby is born. Why before birth? Because if you go into labor with them unresolved, unexpressed, and hidden, they will turn into complications. All complications at birth are caused by hidden and unexpressed emotions. Yes, that is the subtle cause. I know it sounds strange, but you would not want to experience this firsthand. Especially now that you know, I can help you, I can show you, I can teach you what to do so you do not have to go through something like this—especially at birth, when all women want a beautiful experience, not just during pregnancy.

Now, the first cause that all women say they struggle with is nausea during pregnancy. Nausea is exactly the emotional cause of changes—changes in my body that provoke a feeling of aversion. When I feel nauseous, I cannot “swallow” a situation, I want to spit it out, to vomit it out. Whether it is nausea or vomiting, when a woman becomes pregnant, she becomes afraid. As I said, she is overwhelmed by fear, by conscious and unconscious memories, she may become angry or frustrated because she no longer feels safe, because suddenly things are changing, because the baby brings many challenges. Most women wonder how they will manage, if they are ready for this important step. Invariably, all of us who have been pregnant have wondered or been afraid to become mothers, asking ourselves if we will be good mothers. The good news is, if this child chose you, it is clear that you are the perfect mother for this child. But yes, these thoughts trouble us.

Usually, pregnancy nausea comes from a non-acceptance of change. It comes from rejecting the new situation. We doubt ourselves, thinking we are not good enough mothers or feel we are not ready to become mothers. And believe me, even if you thought you were prepared, you will still feel unprepared. You will feel helpless, insecure, afraid. You will feel overwhelmed by responsibilities. And yes, that is true. An immense responsibility is coming your way. Then you will worry that you will have to give up your career. You will think you might lose your freedom. You will think your life will change 180 degrees and wonder if you are really ready for this step. These are all the questions that arise in every woman’s mind, whether she wanted the child very much and worked for it, or it happened unexpectedly. All these emotions, depending on their intensity, will cause nausea either in the first two or three months, or, if they are very strong and come with unconscious intensity, throughout the pregnancy. It is not normal for it to last the entire pregnancy.

When we have symptoms, all we need to do is become aware of where they come from, so we can explain them. When the mind finds an explanation, the symptoms disappear. Why? Because the conflict in the mind disappears. So, it is simpler than you think. And yes, there is no need to take pills or eat pharmaceutical products to get rid of nausea.

Next, most women, when pregnant, will feel heartburn. You literally feel burning, you cannot swallow, you feel like you have eaten bile. When you feel burning in your chest and cannot swallow, know that it is not from what you ate or drank, but simply an emotional state where you have difficulty swallowing a new reality. What is this new reality? It is the change that comes with this pregnancy and its challenges. So, ask yourself: what can you not “swallow” about this situation? Or what is burning inside you and making you angry? Because these heartburns actually show the need to freely express your needs without feeling constrained or afraid of judgment.

What does it mean to feel constrained? Maybe this pregnancy makes you feel trapped in a new “movie,” or you are afraid of what others will say. It is very important how and why we think the way we do about others. So, you no longer want to swallow your words and stay silent. Usually, when we feel burning, we want to say something. We no longer want to swallow our words and be silent. That is the first sign—heartburn. So, what you can do is observe exactly when the heartburn appears, what mental conflict you are in, what you are thinking about, what is worrying you, what is consuming you, what conflict you have, and analyze your life situation to convince yourself that life is good to you and you can savor it and allow yourself time to enjoy every moment. These are phrases that might help you when you feel heartburn and cannot sleep or go about your daily life because of it.

Vomiting. Vomiting is more than nausea. Vomiting is when you literally cannot go anywhere because fear paralyzes you and blocks your digestion. You can no longer digest. It is too much for you. All these things refer to emotions and the situation itself, where you worry about finances, your career, your future life, or you think, “What aspects of my life do I need to change, and am I very afraid?” There are many thoughts that overwhelm a pregnant woman. Vomiting also comes from a strong aversion to this situation, so strong that you want to vomit. When you vomit, that feeling of being overwhelmed comes out of you, and that helps you. It is clear that you cannot digest a new situation in your life.

There are some phrases that can help calm your subconscious mind, which brings these fears to the surface. You could tell yourself, “I accept what is happening to me and move forward with confidence toward a new experience. I accept change and no longer stubbornly try to keep things in the old energy. I feel deep gratitude because it helps me heal unpleasant symptoms.” So, vomiting, nausea, and heartburn always have a deep emotional cause that you know. No one needs to tell you, because deep down you know very well what is not working and what you cannot “swallow.”

Edema and swelling of the limbs is a buildup of water. What is water? On an emotional or subtle level, water represents the emotions we hold in our bodies and do not allow to manifest because we do not express them, we keep them inside for various reasons. That is why a woman who holds her emotions inside and clings to situations from the past or to people, who does not cry and holds back her tears so as not to bother others with her problems, actually feels blocked in a certain life situation. If this is your case, it is clear that it is normal for your legs to swell. Now, it is not good for your whole body to swell. But yes, in pregnancy, because we tend to feel somehow trapped in another life situation, with a lot of fear, with life suddenly seeming unfair because I have to give up work, give up my life. A child is coming who will take up the next two years completely, right? And of course, I will not tell anyone what really bothers me, because I am ashamed, it is not done. And then my body swells. I swell to create a wall of defense so I will not be hurt again, because I do not like the direction I am heading. Everything is filled with a lot of uncertainty.

There are also positive affirmations I recommend you read as often as possible, especially if you see that you suffer from these edemas. So: “I validate my fears and look at them with compassion, understanding their reason.” Yes, it is your right to have these emotions. What matters is what you do with them. Another phrase: “I am learning to accept my needs and express them without others feeling threatened by them.” “I allow myself to be me and to understand myself on a deep level,” and “I allow myself to feel the joy of living again.” Yes, you are allowed to enjoy life. You are allowed to express yourself. Especially now, I actually recommend you have a friend or two or five with whom to talk about these fears, because if not, your body will indeed accumulate those emotions and swell.

Let’s see why pregnant women are prone to experiencing cramps, especially in the calves, at night. When these muscle cramps occur, it is clear that there is a conflict within you. A conflict that can be explained by not liking where you are in your life right now, not liking what you are doing or what you are forced to do now; you are frightened by the direction you are heading, you are looking for your place, preparing your nest. Again, very important, a pregnant woman does this, that is why you will feel the urge to renovate and all that. “I do not yet see myself as a mother because I simply cannot picture myself there.” “My life is no longer full of mystery and suspense, and that is why I no longer feel enthusiasm.” “I feel stuck, and cramps will appear.” “I no longer recognize myself in my current life structure.” “I am no longer honest with myself, I am lying to myself.” “I tell myself that maybe the relationship is better than I think.” Maybe it will be easy, or who knows, right? There are things I tell myself that are not really true.

Cramps can also appear if I am carrying the burdens of life. When you carry something heavy, you feel tied down. “I am afraid I will not be able to love my own child enough, and I am afraid I will lose myself with the arrival of this child.” So yes, many of a pregnant woman’s worries are on the themes I keep mentioning, even though we have all sorts of different manifestations.

Now, the phrases you can repeat are: “I am confident I will receive the necessary support and help,” and it would be good to learn to ask for support. “I embrace my new role as a mother in my roles as a woman.” “I trust that I will handle the new life situation with ease.” “I am learning to ask for help and to express my emotions easily.” “I allow myself to move toward a new life with full commitment.” Yes, many things are coming your way. And yes, you need to ask for help.

Now, most women complain of back pain during pregnancy. Back pain indicates a fear of moving in a new direction, especially if the pain radiates down a leg, either the right or the left. Because when it blocks my ability to walk, it is clear that back pain not only shows that I am carrying a lot of responsibility on my back. Usually, I am carrying others on my back. When it also blocks my leg, know that it has nothing to do with the sciatic nerve. It hurts, but the baby is not pressing on any nerve, just as you are not being “pressed on nerves”; it is simply a fear of moving forward in a new direction. This new direction that life has brought you with this pregnancy. So, back pain is not normal. It is clear that you are carrying someone. If it also blocks your legs, it is clear that you are afraid to move in a certain direction. If you are right-handed, the right means the future, that is, the right leg. If you are left-handed, the right means the past. So, either you are afraid to move into the future or the past, depending on which leg hurts.

High blood pressure in pregnancy. What does high blood pressure mean? It means a lot of tension. High tension happens when there is a lot of activity and pressure inside me. I feel like I am in a pressure cooker, one where the lid does not come off and it starts to whistle. Yes? I have accumulated too many emotions inside that make me feel like I am going to explode. That is why it is said that women in pregnancy have slightly higher blood pressure. The greater the fear, the greater the emotional tension, the more the woman’s pulse will increase. So, when you are “boiling” inside, figuratively, and you have enormous pressure on you, when you swallow your anger, tension and nervousness raise your blood pressure. You are always alert because you feel somehow threatened and experience a lot of mental and emotional tension. All these things raise your blood pressure, and you should understand that this is not beneficial for you or your baby. You should learn to release your inner tension slowly and gradually, through concrete actions. It is very important to talk to express yourself, not to keep it inside like in a pressure cooker, to trust your own discernment, and to accept the situation and yourself as you are, and to stop putting pressure on yourself, because that raises your pulse.

Now, of course, there is also the possibility of having too low blood pressure or hypoglycemia during pregnancy. When we have low blood pressure, we are actually seeking love due to a lack of tenderness, a lack of intimacy. We have an unmet need to be recognized or rewarded. You probably give too much to others and nothing is left for you. So yes, your blood pressure drops because you actually want to run away from life and from yourself, you feel the need to give up. You no longer have the strength for life, you feel faint when you literally cannot go on. Then yes, your blood pressure drops, especially when there is a lot of sadness because no one has met your expectations. Then you clearly feel drained and prefer to play the victim. So, for such moments, when you feel all these things and they overwhelm you, you need to talk to yourself and tell yourself that you accept what is happening to you, that you let go of unpleasant situations in your life, that you learn to give to yourself first, then to others, and you prioritize yourself, listen to and validate your own needs, and accept your role as a leader instead of a victim. It does not help to fall into a pit of melancholy, because it is too important for you to be well, because your baby also suffers when you do not feel okay.

Now... Preeclampsia in pregnancy. You should know that this is quite a serious issue. When you reach eclampsia, you clearly cannot give birth naturally. But preeclampsia does not mean high blood pressure during pregnancy. Preeclampsia is diagnosed only based on protein analysis in the urine. So, do not be fooled by other phrases, because I have heard many versions of eclampsia. It is a very serious disease that resembles epileptic seizures. Before you get there, it is a long way! But the idea is that if you know you suffer from this, it can only be confirmed by protein analysis in the urine. When we suffer from this, there is a lot of guilt, insecurity about this child and the birth. Usually, there is unexpressed anger toward the partner because you blame him for the pregnancy. You do not want to become a mother and cannot accept that this will happen soon, and you feel trapped in a situation like a prison with no escape and do not know how to react to it. Because you also have some fears. Fear of death during childbirth, yours and the baby’s. All these things might come from childhood, from memories, from the subconscious. Yes, you will feel if this is the case. Here, too, there are phrases to help you rewrite these erroneous programs, to help you accept the arrival of this child in your life. Accept that he or she will be the center of attention without resisting. Because this child will not make you invisible. You are strong enough to go through this experience successfully, and you can visualize your pregnancy and birth going perfectly.

Now, let’s see how and what we should do to get rid of the wonderful vaginal candidiasis. It is called Candida Albicans, or rather, it is the moment when the vaginal flora becomes active, protecting the vaginal canal. So, Candida is activated when there is a conflict of invasion. These emotional conflicts are related to your own sexuality in relation to your partner. You may be afraid of sexual activity and intimacy with your partner for various reasons, especially during pregnancy. That is not the case. Sex is not forbidden during pregnancy, nor are romantic interactions. So, you need to see where this fear comes from, which you acquired at some point and which blocks your intimacy with your partner. If you feel emotionally and sexually assaulted, it is clear that there are memories of childhood abuse. Please, I recommend you do something about it. Any kind of sexual abuse will manifest as a phenomenal blockage during birth. So, do not let things remain as they are; address and resolve them, because all these unconscious or conscious issues will manifest as blockages during birth.

So, if your body has activated sexual abuse traumas during a romantic union, you need more time, more romance, to open up emotionally. Then you will not get Candida. If something about the romantic interaction irritates or frustrates you—maybe your partner did not take enough time, maybe he was not tender enough—all these things can cause the vaginal flora to become more acidic and turn into candidiasis. Usually, women who feel emotionally closed and find it very hard to surrender to their vulnerability suffer from Candida. Think about it: when we go to the gynecologist and are examined, for me, it is not a pleasant thing, not at all. And every time the doctor inserts the speculum, the next day I get Candida. It is not because the speculum is not sterile, but simply because I felt assaulted. And the assault is sexual, because the vulva is an intimate place, a place of sexuality, which belongs to me, and if it is abused, it triggers that defense action. Yes, and then, of course, there are also phrases here to help change these programs that are running in us. I have the power and courage to get out of the victim state. Yes, you no longer have to consider yourself a victim. You can say no. I take responsibility for my sexual and emotional needs and learn to express them. It is very important to express what you want. You can want sexual activity and ask for it, because it is okay and normal to have sexual activity during pregnancy. You can embrace naivety and vulnerability as valuable qualities. I respect myself and my emotional needs, and I am patient with myself and my partner because I express my emotions. You see, expressing emotions is the most important—the key, in fact. If you do not express your needs, whether sexual, physical, psychological, romantic, of all kinds, you end up having these reactions, which are normal for the body.

Now, since we are talking about the vulva, let’s talk about vaginal discharge during pregnancy. First, I want to make a distinction. There are physiological causes that manifest as preparation of the vagina for birth. About two or three weeks before birth, there is more abundant vaginal discharge. Why? It prepares the vagina for delivery. Now, I will refer here to vaginal discharge during pregnancy, which, of course, has emotional causes. You should know that the idea that “oh my, what did my partner do, what did he bring me from who knows where,” is wrong. All the emotions we experience during lovemaking or as sexual frustration can cause—and actually do cause—these discharges or disturbances in vaginal discharge. The emotional causes for these discharges are feelings of guilt or shame, especially shame related to my sexual activity. Religious preconceptions that make me feel guilty—pay close attention here, because dogmas are the number one enemy. You can feel guilty for your natural desire to live and experience pleasure, because we received these gifts to enjoy them, not to take them to heaven. So, refusing romantic interactions with your partner can lead to such vaginal discharges. Of course, feelings of guilt or aggression toward your partner can also cause vaginal discharges. Then there is also the lack of control over your partner regarding these interactions. If he refuses, then yes, it can become your anger and maximum frustration that nothing is happening. Because, who knows, your partner may have phobias or who knows what else he has heard and thinks it is totally wrong. It is not wrong to have romantic interactions during pregnancy. The child has no problem with it. Plus, all children come with sexual energy, so there is no reason to block this energy, which is natural and healthy. The need for victimization and the need to beg for love outside myself—here, when a woman starts begging, it is clear that things will happen at the vaginal level, meaning discharges.

The phrases you can use to change these programs are: “I am in touch with my own sexual desires and needs.” “I regain my emotional balance, put myself and my desires first.” “I know my worth and can control my life decisions.”

Good, another condition: cystitis during pregnancy. Cystitis or urinary tract infections have a subtle connection to sexual frustrations. Sexual frustrations come in many forms. I cannot express my negative emotions, and that inflames the urinary tract. That is where the burning sensation comes from when you cannot express your negative emotions. When I cannot find my place in relationships, in my relationship, at this moment in life. When I am angry at the opposite sex, at my partner, when I feel helpless, when I feel put in an impossible situation because of my partner, when I feel powerless in the face of all the challenges of this pregnancy and birth, and especially when I let others run my life instead of making important decisions for myself and my child. Yes, very often we realize that others are making decisions for us and our child, which is not natural. “It is time to take my life into my own hands. I make responsible and assumed decisions and no longer let others decide for me. I set clear boundaries with others. I learn to say no to protect myself and my emotional and sexual needs.” So, cystitis is about setting boundaries and learning to say no. Very important.

Now, another very unpleasant thing: genital, labial, or oral herpes. Regardless of where it manifests—on the labia (genital herpes) or on the lips or nose area—these are sexual frustrations or disappointments with your partner. The sexual frustration may be so great because your partner does not want romantic interaction during pregnancy, for totally wrong reasons. Frustration from too much or too little romantic interaction. That is, you do not receive enough love or you feel the need to withdraw because...

I create something to keep the other person away for a while. And this is possible. Here, the nuances are very subtle. Every woman needs to see what the nuance is, what she is doing. Ah, that's it! What is she doing? Aha! Or the trigger? Yes, I need a break so I can get back up again. Those who get herpes want to interrupt communication and closeness with others for a while. A break is needed. Herpes appears when I feel forced to do or accept something. Especially for the woman who accepts romantic interaction because she has to. So, herpes comes from frustration and being forced. When do you feel guilty, ashamed, because you accepted compromises you are not proud of? So what do we do then? Well, we can change those programs in our minds, we can say no, we can refuse, we can take a break, we can stop feeling forced. And yes, I accept my sexuality and my sexual and emotional needs. I stop judging myself so harshly and I am proud of who I am and how I express myself, and I stop punishing myself. Yes, herpes also has a masochistic aspect, by the way. I free myself from religious dogmas that accuse women for their natural sexual desires and needs. Be careful here, we are not sinners! And I accept myself as I am and I enjoy my sexuality. If sexuality was not meant to be and was such a dirty thing, why were we given these abilities? There are longer discussions here, but what if we were a bit freer and allowed ourselves to feel when it is time to feel?

Hemorrhoids during pregnancy, when going to the bathroom for a bowel movement becomes a chore. Hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids appear when the stress caused by my thoughts about pregnancy becomes overwhelming. So, when I think a lot about this pregnancy and its problems, I get very stressed. And yes, hemorrhoids have a subtle connection with the relationship with the mother. Of course, for any woman, during pregnancy the relationship with the mother is activated, because we too were in a close connection with our mother when we came into this world. That’s why, you see, these things overlap. There is a contradiction between surrendering and resisting the flow, because when I let go, that is, release, the flow is natural. When I start to block and say, ah, no, wait, I don’t like what’s happening, I actually block the flow. Why might I block the flow during pregnancy? Because pregnancy comes with many unknown factors. That’s why I feel overwhelmed by all the responsibilities that come with this pregnancy. The closer the birth approaches, the more panic and fear of the unknown take over. I feel like I am in a hopeless situation and I feel obliged to cope. The pressure of this pregnancy is immense and I don’t know how to get out of the situation honorably, and I hand over the birth to the medical system because I can’t manage to prepare myself for this new life situation, or even to find myself, not just to prepare. So, when I no longer find myself, when I am afraid of the future, hemorrhoids clearly appear.

And now, what could I do? What phrases could I repeat? I take my pregnancy and birth into my own hands and I inform myself to understand the process, to eliminate that fear. I resolve my fears related to birth, again about fears, so I can live my pregnancy with joy and take my power back, so I can regain my enthusiasm and confidence.

And now—panic attacks, which yes, many women experience during pregnancy. And by the way, panic attacks clearly come from a childhood that was not quite okay. That’s why a pregnant woman suffers from panic attacks if she feels suffocated in her vital space, if she does not trust her decisions, if she no longer finds her inner balance, if she feels forced by circumstances, and if she also has a fear of the unknown. And now we have them all. Why? Because no one teaches us about pregnancy, so the fear of the unknown is justified. And so, to get rid of panic, you need to regain your confidence. You need to take time to explore your fears. Anyway, any kind of course, any kind of information about pregnancy helps you eliminate fears. That’s why you need to know what causes your anxiety. So don’t sweep it under the rug, bring it to the surface, because if you leave it there, it will manifest as blockages during birth and a difficult birth. So it’s not worth ruining your experience, because there are many therapists or people who can help you look confidently in this new direction of your life.

That’s about it regarding the things that bother us during pregnancy. I look forward to seeing you in my next video about pregnancy and birth.
