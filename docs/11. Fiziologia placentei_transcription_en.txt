Warm greetings to you, my dear! I am Dita Depner, and I am glad to see you again at a course on the physiology of the placenta. In this slide, I will talk to you about what the placenta is and how this external organ of your baby takes care of the baby in the womb. We will discuss the anatomy of the placenta, I will tell you about the stages of placental development, especially about things you might need to know regarding the developmental stages that some doctors might describe to you as, let's say, dangerous or pathological, which is not true. So, we will talk about the degree of calcification, as they like to call it, or rather, I will talk about the stages of placental maturation, so you will no longer be afraid that your placenta, you see, is not doing its job. On the contrary, the placenta does its job, and I will show you when the placenta completes its role as a supporter of life. We will also talk about myths, about the placenta as a way to convince you to have as many ultrasounds as possible, because this is also a rather controversial subject. We will also discuss intrauterine growth restrictions, especially the emotional and physical causes. And yes, the placenta is connected to the baby through the umbilical cord. We will also talk about the pulsation of the umbilical cord and the role of placental blood transfer from the baby to the placenta and vice versa. I will also tell you a bit about the duration of the pulsation after birth, of the umbilical cord. And what the placenta actually looks like and how it resembles the tree of life. And yes, we will also talk about the location of stem cells during pregnancy, about the physiology of the placenta. How the mother's blood never mixes with the baby's blood in the womb, and about the anatomy, where one part is attached to the uterine wall and the other part goes towards the baby and forms the umbilical cord. So, let's start talking about the placenta, which, in my opinion, is the most important external organ or the stem cell bank of your child. Did you know that the baby in the womb will never hit its own placenta? I have also mentioned this in a course about, I think, ultrasounds, so you can figure out where your placenta is positioned in the womb. You should know that the baby is so intelligent that it does not hit the organ that supports its life. So, if you are very attentive and can observe yourself, you could figure out how the baby is positioned. Because where the baby kicks with its feet, it does so more vigorously and you can feel it. Where it moves its hands, you feel a tickling sensation in the womb. Yes, because it does not have as much strength, and you can observe, depending on where the baby kicks and moves the most, you can figure out where, let's say, it never targets. That is where your placenta is. The placenta is usually located somewhere inside your abdomen, not on the outside where the belly grows, but rather on the inside, lateral or upper, so towards your body, somehow protected, precisely so it can nourish and grow your baby in the womb. The placenta becomes functional at the beginning of the second trimester. Until then, the baby does not feed from the placenta, but from the yolk sac. I will show you this in another slide, but the placenta actually becomes active only from the second trimester, that is, after twelve weeks of pregnancy. What it looks like is a spongy sponge that is attached with this rounded part to the uterus, and the part above the baby leaves with the umbilical cord, which has a thicker vein and two arteries, or sometimes just one artery, which extracts nutrients and all the nutritional elements needed to grow your baby from the placental blood circuit and sends these nutrients and oxygen to the baby through the umbilical cord. Let's see how the placenta develops. I will show you in another slide that until the first trimester, the placenta develops from nothing, yes? Up to, let's say, stage zero or grade zero. Why is it called grade zero? Because it is not yet functional in the first trimester of your baby's life. It comes into play after twelve weeks, when the child starts to feed, and it is said to have several stages of development, four stages. Zero is when it develops up to twelve weeks. Grade one placenta is after twelve weeks, grade two placenta is in the middle of pregnancy, and grade three placenta is just before birth. So, nothing to be afraid of. This degree of maturation or development of the placenta is normal, it is not pathology. It is simply a matter of observation. It is like observing the stages of development of a child from one to three years old. It does not mean that at three years old the child is old or no longer functional. It is simply in a stage of development. That is why I am telling you about this, because there is no degree of calcification. The placenta does not calcify in the sense that it hardens and becomes stone, as you might imagine when you hear the word calcification, but it is just a stage of placental maturation. Maturation does not mean aging. So, calcification of the placenta during pregnancy has no clinical or pathological significance. As I said before, grade zero is when the placenta is still forming, and the embryo feeds from the yolk sac. At the end of the first trimester, we have grade one, which starts from week eighteen to twenty-nine. So, we simply have a degree of development, yes? A degree of maturation. Grade two starts from week thirty to thirty-eight, and grade three means from week thirty-nine until birth. Regardless of whether you give birth at thirty-nine weeks, forty weeks, forty-two weeks, or forty-three weeks, it is always grade three. So, it does not age like an old woman who, at ninety years old, starts to tremble and can no longer do her job properly, right? The placenta does not age, it matures or ripens or, anyway. Here, depending on how honest your doctor is and how much they want to subscribe you to as many, let's say, ultrasounds as possible, they will come with such arguments or not, and when they do, you can tell them that yes, there are three degrees of placental maturation and that grade three is from week thirty-nine until birth. There is no grade four or grade five, that it has exceeded its duties or its term. So, this is what I want to tell you, so you are no longer influenced by ideas that are not true and that, in fact, only want to induce a state of fear and dependency. One more very important thing, which I always say: When you feel, especially during pregnancy, that someone wants to make you dependent on them or on the salvation they offer you, think again, because there is an interest there, and the interest is not necessarily in favor of your baby or yourself. So, it is not correct to misinform that there are problems with the placenta as long as this measurement has no pathological significance. This is just so you understand. So, the placenta completes its vital role about twenty-five minutes after the baby is born and never sooner. After the baby is born, it remains attached to the uterus and continues to pulse. What does it do? It pulses the blood that is inside it towards the baby through the umbilical cord, filling the baby's body with the blood that was already circulating between the placenta and the baby. The placenta has very precise functions. It does not become lazier or more sluggish towards the end, nor does it want to malnourish the baby in the womb. The placenta does not have a brain of its own to become biased or bad and stop nourishing your child. It is the child's organ, and depending on your state, you give the child confidence to develop and harmonize its development. If you truly live only in fear, terror, and erroneous diagnoses, yes, then you can influence the functioning and growth of the baby in the womb. But the placenta does not have destructive ideas, it is not lazier, it does not end its role prematurely. The placenta does its job. Yes, it is an external organ. And now, any kind of intrauterine growth restriction, you should know, comes very much from unresolved emotional problems and conflicts of yours, at a conscious or subconscious level. If you, for example, were not a wanted child or your mother tried to abort you, or your husband, your partner with whom you conceived this child, had such situations in life, the child picks up on these things at the limbic level, yes, the limbic brain, it remembers all these things and can cause growth restriction. So, the fear that, oh no, my baby is not growing in my belly. The fear that I am not eating well... All these fears are not just a single cause. So, all these things need to be investigated. If you know or feel or notice that you have an obsession with this, it would be good to follow this obsession, to see where it leads you in your childhood so you can resolve them. Because, indeed, by resolving emotional causes, things will function well again. So, it is very important to know your subconscious and to explore all the fears you have and that come to the surface during pregnancy. They come to the surface and you will be able to observe them. You should not be afraid, "Oh no, what if I don't realize it!" You will realize it, because they come to the surface precisely so you can resolve them. So, the placenta completes its role of supporting life when the pulsation ends, and the umbilical cord after birth, at about twenty-five minutes, becomes white and soft. This is what an umbilical cord that is still pulsing looks like. Here you can also see how large the vein is. And this pulsation actually facilitates a transfer of placental blood with stem cells into the child's body. Why? Because until birth, stem cells have developed in the placenta, not in the child's body. They will be transferred into the child's body after birth, when the umbilical cord pulses, this time only in one direction, all the blood from the placenta, along with the stem cells, into the child's body. So, this is something the placenta does, and we simply do not know it. We have the impression that stem cells must be collected, to be given away. No! The stem cells, right now, when they should reach the child's body, we should allow this to happen so the child can use their own stem cells. The stem cells are not for some banks in Greece or Denmark. The stem cells belong to your child. As long as you do not give them to the child, it means you are taking them away. Yes, I know, it sounds shocking, but of course, you will not hear this from an entire industry that does not even buy, but sells your child's cells for a lot of money. I mean, think about how much money you pay to sell your child's stem cells. There is a nonsense here. We pay money to sell. We should be paid for the stem cells we give, not pay. But look, there is also reverse psychology, and the more fear there is, the more people will react accordingly, buying, let's say, peace of mind that they did everything they knew. Yes, but you just sold your child's stem cells, instead of keeping them and giving them to the child, because they belong to the child. And now, what you see in the picture is a piece of umbilical cord after it has been cut, which is white, soft, and flaccid. That is when the transfer of placental blood, along with the stem cells, has been completed. This is what an umbilical cord looks like through which blood no longer pulses because the transfer is finished. And this means respecting the child's right to receive their own stem cells, which have been grown during the nine months of gestation in the placenta. The placenta is what nourishes and oxygenates your baby in the womb. This is what a placenta looks like after birth. You see that the umbilical cord is white. After the placenta is born, the cord no longer pulses, so the placenta becomes an inert organ after the pulsation ends. The pulsation usually lasts twenty to twenty-five minutes, but you can observe it by pressing your fingers on the umbilical cord. It is very simple. So, it is not complicated to know when or how to do it. Here you see the placenta, the tree of life, it looks like a tree, and we have many examples in nature, in leaves and many other plants, how those veins and all those blood vessels perfectly imitate life everywhere in nature. Here, the tree of life, the placenta, the veins. Yes, look at the veins in leaves. Here is what rivers and waters look like. Yes, look at the lung. Exactly like a placenta. Look at a tree. Look at a cross-section of a trunk. And look at our fingerprints. The placenta is an endocrine organ because it produces hormones. It produces estrogen and progesterone. And again, as I said, only in the placenta are the child's stem cells found. They form there from the moment the placenta forms, let's say, week eighteen until the child is born. That is where the stem cells form, and stem cells are intelligent cells whose role, after birth—nature knows this is a very important and intense event in a person's life, in any being's life—after birth, that transfer of placental blood, which comes with all the intelligent cells, has the role of repairing any kind of damage or problems that occurred during the intensity of birth. That is why stem cells do not form in the child's body, but in this external organ, and after birth, they will be transferred through the umbilical cord with the pulsation of placental blood into the child's body, precisely because then the child needs those stem cells, intelligent cells that repair any problems that occurred during birth. Because birth for a baby is not something simple, but something intense, and things happen there. That transition from the uterus into our world is not simple. And so, this support system exists precisely to help make this transition as easy and efficient as possible. That is why stem cells will go and search throughout the body for places where damage has occurred, to repair them. That is the quality of stem cells. They can transform into any type of cell. That is why they do not have a precise utility. That is why they are called stem cells. That is why they are so valuable. And it is not the price that gives them value, but the fact that they are stem cells. What does the placenta do? The placenta nourishes and oxygenates the fetus with nutrients and oxygen received from the mother's blood circuit. Here we have a peculiarity. We receive oxygen and food from the mother's blood circuit, but we do not receive her blood. Why? Because that is the role of the placenta, to filter. The placenta is like a, hmm, I don't know how to say it. It receives and assimilates food and oxygen, nutrients and oxygen from the blood circuit, but they do not mix. So, the mother's blood never mixes with the baby's blood during pregnancy or at birth. So, if you have ever heard from someone that, oh my, the blood mixes, that your blood might not be good, might be sick, might be whatever, it does not mix. The child may even have the same blood type, but will not have the same blood. So, the mother's blood does not mix with the baby's blood. The nutrients and oxygen that are in the mother's blood circuit will be passed on like a relay. But it will not be the same runner. The runner that brings oxygen and food to the baby is the blood in the baby's own circuit. The one that brings food and oxygen to the baby's blood circuit is the mother's blood circuit. So, the two circuits do not mix. They only pass the baton. The baton is the food and oxygen. So, it is very simple if you can picture it this way and understand why the two fluids, even if they transport something in common, never mix during pregnancy or birth. This is what a placenta looks like. The part you see here is the part that attaches and is somehow attached to the uterine wall. So, it is the part that after birth, after it no longer pulses and after it has transmitted the stem cells and all the blood that was in the placenta, which is part of the baby's blood, has transmitted the blood and stem cells. This part is the one attached to the uterus and will detach to be born after the pulsation ends. The placenta does not detach before. The placenta detaches only when it has finished its job. What you see here is the umbilical cord coming from the other side of the placenta, and here you see a piece of membrane. The membrane, which is like a thin film, here is gathered. I will show you other pictures where you will see what the membrane or amniotic sac in which the baby is looks like. So, the mother's blood never mixes with the baby's blood, even though they meet and pass on oxygen and nutrients. Here you can see better the side towards the baby with the umbilical cord. And here you can really see what a placenta looks like. It is an organ that is very full of blood and also has some blood clots on it, on the surface, when it attaches to the uterus. So, you can see very clearly if it is whole or what it looks like and what these blood clots are. They are all exactly as they should be. I will present more things about the placenta in a future lesson. Thank you.
