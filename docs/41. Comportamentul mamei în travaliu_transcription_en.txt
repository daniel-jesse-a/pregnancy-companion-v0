The sixth clear sign that labor is progressing. We established this when we discussed contractions and breathing through dilation contractions. Please watch that video. A distinct sign by which the mother can signal to those around her that she is in labor. With a smile on her face, the mother closes her eyes and focuses on dilation breathing. This is a clear sign. This is how a woman behaves during the first dilation contractions. She is relaxed, closes her eyes, and concentrates. When she opens them, after the contraction has passed, she is cheerful, talkative, laughing, able to engage in any kind of conversation. She is happy that the baby is coming and there is communication. 

Now, how do you know that after the first part, let's say when she is smiling, talkative, and chatty, at some point, a clear sign that labor is advancing is that she is no longer as talkative. The sensations intensify, which is visible to the naked eye. Let me show you again the mother breathing through her first contractions. Yes, after each contraction, she is very present and has conversations with her partner, the midwife, or whoever is there. Well, after a while, these contractions intensify. Look at her face. Look at her gestures. Look at her facial expression. This is a clear sign that labor is advancing because with each subsequent contraction, the sensations intensify. 

So, you don't need to measure a woman's dilation with invasive vaginal exams, which are clearly a form of obstetric violence. In fact, there is an international campaign to stop obstetric violence, not just in Romania. The idea is that the woman does not need to be checked for those around her to know what stage of labor she is in. You can see it from her expressions, and I am telling you these things. You might not hear them in any course because people don't take the time to observe. They prefer to measure, to insert their fingers, to check dilation, to do other things. 

The intensity of the contractions makes the mother become increasingly focused and turned inward. You can see here how she breathes through her contractions. You can see how focused she is and how little present she is externally. She is very much focused inward. At these moments, the woman automatically enters a trance. It is called the birth trance. It is a trance induced by hormones, by her state, because she disconnects so much from what is happening around her that nothing else matters. She is only interested in what is happening in her body and inside her body. That is why the contractions intensify. And not only do they intensify, but the contractions make her internalize very deeply. 

When you see that she is no longer joking, no longer opens her eyes, and even after the contraction has passed, she keeps her eyes closed and is focused, please, do not wake her from the trance. Michel Odent beautifully said: Never wake a woman from the birth trance, because you disrupt her entire process, all the work, all the contractions she has breathed through and integrated could be lost if you pull her out of that state. She would have to start from zero. And it’s not worth it, because she only needs to give birth. You, as her partner, will take over all discussions with the medical staff. That is why it is vital for you to be informed as well. That is actually the secret: to be a team. You, as a man, protect her, have her back, and take over conversations with the rest of the world, so she can do her job, handle the contractions, breathe through them, and help the baby be born. That is teamwork.

Another clear sign that labor is advancing are sudden changes in body temperature, which make her become irritable, impossible, and very hard to please. I am not joking. At some point, the woman in labor will yell, scream, not from pain, but at you: open the window, it’s too hot, close the door, I’m cold. Turn on the heater, I don’t like it. Blow out the candles, turn on the light, turn off the light. You’re annoying me! Get out! Come in! Splash me with water! Give me a compress! In those moments, the woman adopts a commanding attitude, but not because she wants to be the boss, but she actually takes on a threatening, commanding attitude. Just so you understand, this is temporary and all women experience it when labor unfolds naturally and is not induced or forced.

So, dear ones, rejoice when the woman starts giving orders. (laughs) This should be a reason for joy, because it means labor is advancing. When she becomes irritable, we already have significant dilation, about six or seven centimeters, which is wow! To get there sometimes takes hours, even days of work. So, kiss her when she chases you around and gives you orders, even though she might snap at you, because she is doing an extraordinary job.

If she does not enter this trance state, does not disconnect from the world, and remains at the stage of “I had a contraction, how nice, it’s over, I breathed through it so well!”—that is early labor that is not progressing. Her body stays there for a long time, meaning dilation is nothing or one to two centimeters. If she does not change, not intentionally but involuntarily, if her attitude does not change, she actually has no dilation and remains in that nice, smiling, sweet state.

So, when she becomes irritable, unbearable, very hard to please—not that she isn’t at other times, yes—then we have greater dilation. She will even ask for impossible things, because she does not know how to better cope with the unprecedented, intense demands of her body. You will see her yelling. Kiss her. She is adorable! I know, it drives you crazy, but believe me, she is doing her job. Labor is at an advanced dilation, and she does not know how to cope with these challenges and body intensities except by expressing anger, yes? For example, when she tells you she’s hot, then cold, then— it may seem absurd, but that’s exactly how she feels, and you’re hearing this from someone who has been through two labors and in both had outbursts, feeling embarrassed in front of the doula I was with, to boss her around: “Close the window! Turn off the heat, turn it on! I’m cold, I’m hot, too much air, blow out the candles, turn on the light, turn off the light.” (laughs) So at some point I realized I was so unbearable and I said, please forgive me, I don’t know why I’m like this, I’m not usually like this. But she said, “Don’t worry, you’re fine. This is normal.” Yes, but when you don’t know what’s happening and you’ve never closely observed a woman in labor, you have no way of knowing that these behaviors are extremely good and perfect, yes? 

What’s the good news? Well, (laughs) when she starts giving you instructions and bossing you around and acting unreal, it’s because dilation has reached six to seven centimeters. So, it’s perfect. Kiss her, congratulate her! Artistic moment for <dad>. I’m not joking. Because labor is advancing. I forgot to tell you. You have homework. From now on. Go to the store and buy a mini bottle of champagne, like the ones on airplanes. Don’t get a one-liter bottle, you’ll get drunk. We don’t need parents inebriated at birth. (laughs) Who recommends champagne? We’ll talk about that in a moment. The idea is you need a small, airplane-sized bottle. But a good one. Don’t buy some cheap stuff from Lidl or wherever, buy a good champagne, one she likes to drink. And not plum brandy, not whiskey, champagne... Well, when she becomes irritable, you go and take the champagne from the maternity bag. That’s why I said you’ll have an atypical maternity bag. Take the champagne from the maternity bag and put it in the fridge. Surely, in the hospital where you’ll give birth, you’ll find a fridge in the hallway or in a room somewhere. If not, ask someone to tell you where the nearest fridge is. Or if it’s winter, put it outside the window, it will chill that way too. So what do you have to do? Besides buying champagne these days? And I’m not joking, it’s for real, it’s true. When labor advances and she starts giving orders, at that moment you’ll remember: Ditta said to take the champagne and put it in the fridge. Who recommends this? A wonderful doctor, Dr. Michel Odent. I’ll explain why in a moment. You put it in the fridge now. Well, not now. Then you’ll put the champagne in the fridge for the celebration. Good! This is a logistical task you need to take care of. So you buy the champagne, not the woman. She has other concerns. Clothes and other things. Good, let’s end the artistic moment. Let’s see what the eighth clear sign is that labor is nearing its end. Oops! We’re getting close to the end. So you see, the champagne foretells something nice. 

A clear sign that labor is advancing is when the mother spends more time on the toilet. It means the baby has reached the vagina and expulsion is near. Remember I showed you the cervix thinning, shortening, and causing dilation, after which the baby’s head can slide into the vagina? That means expulsion. When the baby’s head slides into the woman’s vagina. At those moments, and I explain this in the course about contractions and you’ll understand the mechanism better there, the woman feels the need to go to the toilet, as if she needs to have a bowel movement. But it’s not about that, it’s the baby pressing right on the entire pelvic area and giving the sensation of needing to have a bowel movement. But it’s not about that, it’s about the position and the place where she knows, “I go there to do something.” And know that eighty percent of women who have the possibility to go to the toilet will sit on the toilet, with a pillow, like this. And here’s another extraordinary example of what a belly looks like. It’s not deformed, it’s not sick. This is what a belly looks like during a contraction. You can actually see how the uterus works. So, when you see her sitting on the toilet, it’s clear the baby is in expulsion. What does it mean to be in expulsion? There’s just this much left to go through the vaginal canal. That much. So birth may be next. 

The sign that labor is advancing toward the baby’s expulsion is this triangle. You can see the two points here. The triangle that swells the lumbar area of the mother’s pelvis during labor. So, if you look at the woman from behind, she even has a tattoo here pointing exactly to this triangle. This swelling shows you that the baby is close to coming out and is in full expulsion. Look, this is a clear sign that any experienced midwife knows, without needing to keep measuring cervical dilation. So, my dears, besides the fact that checking cervical dilation is abuse, it is obstetric violence and inhibits and stops your labor because it inhibits you, you do not need dilation checks. An experienced midwife just looks at you. A partner who knows the signs—exactly the ones we discussed—observes you and knows what stage you are in. That’s why I asked you to attend this course together, so you can be a team.

This is the sign. Here you can see the swelling better, and it’s called the Michaelis Triangle. Yes? This is the triangle that swells because the baby’s head passes there, enters the vagina, and actually produces this prominence. Just a few more centimeters and you’ll be holding your baby in your arms. And yes, I think you can hardly wait. 

Now, for some women, even if the baby is almost in expulsion or already in expulsion, there is a plateau phase, or as I call it, the stolen nap before the grand finale, where you see the woman who is about to give birth, who until then was lively, focused, and in intense labor, now dozing off. That’s what happened to me at one of my first births and I really didn’t know how to handle the situation. So I just observed. And I did well, because that’s what you should do. If she falls asleep, because the contractions simply stop for a while, it means she is in a plateau phase. The plateau phase is not bad, it’s just a break before the grand finale. It’s as if the woman is given a chance to relax, to take a quick nap, yes, to recharge for the last, most intense part—the baby’s expulsion. So if your loved one falls asleep, it doesn’t matter if it’s for five minutes or ten minutes. Mine slept for over forty minutes. At one point, being the first time and never having encountered this idea, I thought, “Oh no, if we have to start over, that’s really bad.” But no one had to start over. Everything was very quick, and after she woke up, she asked to go to the water pool and in twenty minutes the baby was born. That’s what the plateau phase means. Everything freezes in place. Nothing is lost, you just pick up where you left off. It’s exactly the stolen nap before the grand finale. And who gives this plateau phase? The baby, because he stops the contractions—and please watch the video about contractions to understand how they form, who asks for them, how, what the mother’s response is, that beautiful dance, yes? You’ll understand that the baby gives the mother a break so she can handle the expulsion. How beautiful! Know that your babies really don’t want to hurt you, they want you to get through birth well and for everything to be perfect. So trust them, trust their discernment, trust that they know how to be born. The idea is not to stop them, not to hinder them, not to obstruct them. That’s the most important thing.

The ninth sign is a clear sign that labor is nearing its end. Let’s see what it is. When your loved one who is giving birth says: “I can’t do this anymore, I don’t want to! Leave me alone with your natural birth. I don’t want to hear about Ditta anymore. I don’t want anything. Give me a C-section, give me anesthesia, get the baby out!” These are the phrases usually heard in a delivery room where birth has been allowed to proceed naturally. The woman enters that “I can’t do this anymore” moment. And I’m telling you from experience that at both my births, I had a moment when I said, “Guys, I’m done, I’m leaving, I can’t do this anymore, just get him out, do surgery, do whatever you want, I can’t do this anymore.” It’s like going home to mom. Yes, it’s about the same thing. So, when the plateau phase comes and she exclaims, “I don’t want this anymore, I can’t do this anymore, I don’t want a natural birth, cut me, C-section, total anesthesia... I don’t care.” Go and get the champagne from the fridge, pop the cork, and give her a sip. Because, as Dr. Michel Odent explained, she doesn’t need to get drunk. That’s not the point. But the fact that champagne has bubbles, those bubbles will instantly carry the alcohol to the brain, and that impulse from that sip of champagne—just one sip, don’t let her drink the whole bottle, she might get tipsy. So she just needs one sip, because we don’t want her drunk when she gives birth. Those bubbles will carry the alcohol to the brain and the brain will release oxytocin because she will enter that (mimics sleeping sound) okay, one more time. The truth is, this is the peak intensity phase. It won’t get more intense than this. When she says, “I can’t do this anymore, I don’t want to,” that is the most intense moment. And believe me, she’s right. It is the most intense. In her mind, if another contraction like that comes... No. No. She doesn’t want it. The thing is, it won’t come, because she feels exactly when it’s the maximum. And I promise both of you, and I promise you, dear mother, that from that strongest sensation to birth, it’s all downhill. There won’t be anything stronger or more intense. That’s my promise and it’s true, because that’s how it is. So, from the moment she says, “I don’t want this anymore,” don’t pay attention to her words. Go, give her a sip of champagne, hug her or, if she lets you. Be there for her. Understand her. Don’t tell her she’s talking nonsense or... No, she won’t even hear you. Yes, but be there for her. She’s on the final stretch, the last meter. Yes, that’s all that’s left. So that is the most intense moment. That is the moment for a sip of champagne and reassurance that there is very little left. And you’ll tell her, “There’s very little left. Do you remember what Ditta said in the course?” She might curse me. No problem. I don’t mind. After all the curses I’ve received from others, this one really doesn’t matter. This is one of the good ones. Let her be. There’s very little left. And from that moment, a wave of love will overwhelm her, because the moment of holding and meeting the baby is coming. So that sip of champagne will greatly ease that intense moment. So don’t forget to get champagne. Tomorrow you go and get champagne. Not you, him. (laughs) Good. And now comes the birth. Yes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Yess! You did it! This is the finale. It’s victory, triumph, courage, strength, femininity, wonder, magic, infinite capacity, intensity, tenderness, love, devotion, support, encouragement, grandeur, and affection. This is what birth looks like. He always cries. And she might cry with happiness too. Because this moment is such a shame not to experience together, because it can’t be repeated and you can barely see in pictures how intense it is. No, no, you can’t reproduce it. Look at these images... You can feel how it is. Look at his wet shirt. Look at the places where she held onto him. Look at her face, how happy she is that she succeeded. Look at how admiringly he looks at her and you’ll realize what a moment you would have missed if you hadn’t been there, or what a moment you’ll miss if you’re not there. Another picture. And beautiful! This is the moment when you need to be together. And so what if you cry? It will be tears of gratitude. It will be your victory moment. The woman will feel invincible. The man will be glad he made it and is alive. Yes?... These are real birth photos, not what you see in movies. This is oxytocin, love, affection, support, devotion. This is what awaits you because you are prepared. So thank you for watching, especially this very long video, but I think it’s worth it. Your child is worth it. Thank you.
