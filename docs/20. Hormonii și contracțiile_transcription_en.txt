Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you again for a lesson about hormones and contractions, because you will see that hormones actually initiate labor and maintain contractions. I will talk to you about what types of hormones trigger contractions and what state you need to be in to help these hormones appear. I will explain what triggers the release in the body of this hormone that initiates contractions. We will also discuss how uterine contractions manifest and what triggers this hormone, which reaches the brain and causes contractions in the woman’s body. We will also talk about how other mammals give birth, because, as you’ll see, we’ve come to take notes from other mammals, since we humans have forgotten how to give birth naturally, without medical intervention, without rushing, and without being driven. We will also discuss how not to block this hormone release so you don’t block your labor. We’ll talk about the significance of the golden hour as an aid for birthing the placenta, because after birth there is another birth, a much easier one, incomparable to that of the baby: the birth of the placenta. I will tell you what triggers fear during birth and how it blocks labor. We’ll also discuss optimal positions for cervical dilation, how the baby exits the uterus, and the role of uterine muscles. And at the end of this video, I will show you a short film so you can understand exactly how contractions work. So, let’s get started! We’re talking about the hormones that trigger contractions. Now let’s see what kind of hormones trigger uterine contractions. Is it dopamine, serotonin, endorphins, or oxytocin? First, I want to tell you that all these hormones work together during labor so that the woman feels as little pain as possible during uterine contractions. That’s why our bodies were built in such a way as to handle childbirth. To help you understand that birth is not continuous and that it couldn’t be endured if it were non-stop, without breaks. Thus, our bodies make birth a process divided into many moments, with contractions that expel the baby from the uterus.

Now, dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins are the hormones that help reduce pain sensations in the woman’s body during birth, if the birth is not medically managed. If there is medical intervention, these hormones withdraw and are no longer active. Interventions trigger other interventions, creating an avalanche of interventions to reduce the woman’s pain sensations. Now, what about oxytocin? What is oxytocin? Don’t you remember that endogenous oxytocin, meaning the one produced by your own body, instantly enters the bloodstream and from there goes directly to the brain? Oxytocin is the hormone of love and trust. When we fall in love, we release oxytocin. When we feel good and are happy, oxytocin is released. When we make love, oxytocin is released. When we laugh, oxytocin is released. When we have fun and feel good, oxytocin is released. When we give birth, the largest amount of oxytocin ever is released. Even more than when you fell in love and had butterflies in your stomach. So, oxytocin is also responsible for contractions. It appears in all the stages where we love, rejoice, are enthusiastic, and live life to the fullest. That’s exactly when oxytocin is triggered, when we are in a state of well-being. And this oxytocin instantly enters the bloodstream and reaches the brain. When we fall in love, we feel it throughout our entire body.

So, endogenous oxytocin enters the bloodstream and produces the uterine contractions that start and complete the birth process. To understand what these contractions are, they are exactly what the word says: the uterus contracts, meaning it tightens and then releases, tightens and releases. As you see in this image, the uterus contracts, then relaxes, contracts, relaxes. I’ll show you right away that there are two types of muscles that activate during these contractions to open the cervix. The cervix, with the two arrows pointing up, first needs to shorten, then it will open like sliding doors to create the exit or the door from the uterus to the vagina. To help you understand better, please look at me for a moment. This is the uterus. This is the uterus, yes? This is the cervix. My hands are the cervix, and here, between my two hands, we have a mucus plug. When the uterus starts to contract, my cervix shortens and effaces, meaning nothing hangs into the vagina anymore. From the moment the cervix is effaced, it starts to dilate, because these cervical lips, which were long before, have shortened, effaced, and started to dilate, retracting like sliding doors to the sides.

And this clears the way for the baby to be born. Endogenous oxytocin that reaches the brain, besides producing these contractions, also produces instant analgesia. Why? Because it simultaneously releases beta-endorphins, which anesthetize the woman’s body and make birth an absolutely bearable physiological process, especially since it is divided into many moments of contraction and relaxation with breaks. The breaks at the beginning are very long, maybe ten or fifteen minutes, and then, as labor intensifies and the woman enters that birth trance, they become more frequent as the process advances. So, when the woman does not enter that trance state, the body will not continue to produce effective contractions and labor will not progress. A woman who is in labor for two or three days and is very present, very talkative, very cheerful, is actually not in labor. She is in pre-labor. When a woman enters labor, she no longer wants to communicate with anyone around her.

Because the sensations are so intense that she really needs to focus on those dilation breaths during contractions, and then, after the contractions pass, during the breaks, she prefers to simply remain in that trance, which actually helps her, because it triggers those endorphins in her body that anesthetize her, providing analgesia exactly where it’s needed. Very interesting, isn’t it, that we have anesthesia in our own bodies and that hormone that produces contractions, so everything is very connected. The idea is not to disrupt this process, because the birth process unfolds perfectly as long as we don’t stop it, don’t disrupt it, and don’t pull the woman out of that trance. That’s why Dr. Michel Odent once said: “Never wake a woman from the birth trance.” How can you wake her from the birth trance? Well, for example, I have experienced, while assisting births, a nurse from neonatology coming in the middle of labor with a folder and saying, “Hello, how are you?”

No one paid attention to her because the woman was breathing through her contractions, and then the nurse, thinking she was distracting her from birth, started asking: “Ma’am, I need your social security number and full name and what you’re going to name the baby.” At one point, the woman wasn’t even speaking. She had her eyes closed, she was focused. When contractions came, she breathed through them, and her husband, who was beside her and was perplexed, looked at her and said, “I don’t think she can tell you her social security number.” Then the woman said, “Well then, you give her your social security number.” And the man said, “I’m sorry, this isn’t the time. Come back when we’re done.” The nurse continued, as if she couldn’t snap out of her job, and said, “Then I want the baby’s name.” And the father started laughing because he said, “We don’t know yet if it will be a boy or a girl.” If the nurse, if it weren’t for the father, would have managed to pull that woman, who was in full contractions, almost at expulsion, out of her trance, she would have lost her rhythm and would not have been able to continue. Because, if you remember from the lesson in the basic course, which I hope you have taken, the five secrets of birth, if they are not fulfilled, birth gets blocked, and one of these secrets is to surrender, and this surrender of the woman in labor is exactly what I am talking about now. The trance that the woman automatically enters. A trance that does not need to be induced, nothing needs to be done, just let the woman be and let her labor as she knows how. That’s exactly why all mammals experience birth in peace and with incredible calm. I was present at the birth of my cat when she gave birth to two kittens. The first kitten she brought into the world without a sound.

She had her box, which I had prepared for her, because mammals hide when they give birth. They don’t like to give birth with spectators, just as we don’t like to give birth with spectators or do many other things with spectators. I only heard the kitten meowing and was amazed at how she gave birth, and for the second kitten, she allowed me to be with her and I admired how she simply had contractions. Her body produced those contractions and she was as if she were anesthetized, or I don’t know, in a trance, and at one point she opened her eyes wide and looked at me. She looked into my eyes. I was speechless, because I realized she was looking at me as if waiting for me to tell her everything was fine and to encourage her. And I told her, “Bravo, Shinny, bravo!” I cried. And my cat, who was a cat I rescued from the streets, started to purr, something she had never done before birth.

Why was she so traumatized that she didn’t purr? She purred, but very, very softly, barely noticeable. She had some issues. I think she had been chased, hunted. When she meowed, it was just “Meu,” Laurie didn’t know how to meow. Well, I want to say that during birth, during contractions, she started to purr so loudly that the whole cardboard box vibrated, and after that, with the kittens, she meowed like a normal cat. And I was like, “Shinny, you know how to meow? Yes.” So it was incredible what I discovered, how a cat behaves in those moments. And yes, it was one of the most intimate moments I have experienced at a birth. Not with a woman, but with a cat. And she taught me exactly... She taught me so many things, to understand that we function the same way. When a woman gives birth, she simply needs someone to hold her hand and tell her or whisper to her how extraordinary she is and what she knows to do and how she does it.

And I remember from my own births, especially the second one, where I managed to be present and have a healthy relationship with my body during birth, not to be distracted, not to be in my mind, but simply in my body. And in that trance, I remember how much those moments of encouragement mattered, those moments when I simply felt that everyone trusted that everything was fine and I could trust as well. Because yes, at birth, that’s all that matters. It’s that inner strength that carries you forward, because there are some incredible steps into the unknown. I never thought birth could be so intense until I experienced it, until I was in those moments when I surpassed, I think, all the limits I ever had in this life. And afterwards, when I held my baby in my arms, I felt that whatever else happened to me in this life, I could, I could move mountains, I could...

But it was a feeling that was very strong then. I felt it with every fiber of my being and I didn’t feel it as a phrase that I could move mountains. No. I felt from my whole being that I could do anything. I never had that feeling again in my life, neither before nor after. So, my dear, I wish for you to experience this feeling of triumph, joy, and fulfillment after birth, because it is magnificent and I have many testimonials on my website, ditadepner.ro. Look for them and read the stories of women who had a beautiful birth, even if it was intense, or who redeemed themselves after two, three, five disastrous natural births or after one, two, three cesareans. These are inspirational stories that might be able to convey to you what I cannot put into words now. It’s a feeling that you can hardly describe. What I experienced then I never experienced again. Even though I had many, let’s say, victorious moments in my life, in my career, in business, in my personal life. There were many moments, but none like that. That’s why I think birth is like a drug or, well, like an addiction. Once you’ve experienced it, you want it again, because that moment is so uplifting that nothing else you’ve done until then matters.

Speaking of this, about how cats behave. If this is an example... That calm, that trance. The cat doesn’t scream in pain. She didn’t make a sound, maybe a whimper at one point, right when she was giving birth, but she purred. I was like, “Really, Shine, you’re purring?” But not only was she purring, she was purring while giving birth and I thought, “Is this cat defective? How can she not meow or whimper or make sounds?” No, she simply gave birth and purred. And I was like, “This is the trance before birth.” This is exactly proof that animals manage to go through it easily and with a kind of trust that everything is fine. Because when a cat is in pain, she vocalizes. You know very well how cats behave when they mate, right? Because it hurts. And the cat starts to cry. So it’s not that my cat didn’t know how to cry. My cat didn’t know how to purr. And she purred. And after birth she started to purr and purred. So, you see how a woman changes at birth? I don’t know, it’s incredible. But this, about trance and all mammals that experience birth in peace and with incredible calm. Because they manage to enter that trance, because that trance appears in all mammals. It’s not just in humans or just in cats. We are mammals.

And now, here is an ecstatic birth, a birth where the woman laughs and smiles and has, I don’t even know, feelings of exuberance, enthusiasm, joy. This is exactly what happens at birth. It’s a mechanism of hormone release, which happens in a rhythmic process, depending on the mother’s body’s capacity to handle and not block labor. So, my dear, it doesn’t matter how many degrees you have, what schools you graduated from, it doesn’t matter what bank accounts you have or how many houses you own, or how many cars or what kind of cars you have. At birth, the only thing that matters is the woman in you, that aboriginal woman, the one who has always manifested through you. The woman who has been passed down to you transgenerationally. The woman who carries her labor with pride and responsibility. That’s what matters, because nothing else will matter. It doesn’t matter what you know, because the mind doesn’t matter in such moments, only how you allow birth to manifest through your body and how you cope. That’s all. That’s why it’s said that women who give birth in tribes, tribal women, because there are still many corners in this world where women give birth normally, beautifully. Naturally, in very little time, without fear, because that’s what generations have done and they haven’t absorbed the fear we, Europeans, have.

Americans, yes? Those of us who live, let’s say, in more civilized worlds. That fear of the natural, because they didn’t catch that fear, it wasn’t passed down from generation to generation. Because women have always been supported at birth by other women who knew how to prepare them, to be by their side. The woman does not accumulate fear throughout her life related to the birth process, as we do. Well, I have been afraid of birth for as long as I can remember, because my mother’s story, which she told every time someone came to our house, was as if she needed to tell it again and again, to free herself from that burden, because she almost died at birth, and I associated birth with death. That’s why I experienced my first birth with terror and it was close to death.

If you haven’t watched my presentation about what I went through and how I learned and how I overcame all the challenges in my life and how I got through the at least nine months of depression I had after my first birth, please watch my presentation and you’ll find many resources and insights I’ve had during these years in which I sought to heal my traumas.

So, the hormones that bring contractions and advance labor happen in a rhythmic process, exactly as much as your body can handle and as much as you can handle. That’s why some women need shorter labors, some need longer labors. Some bodies need time, others need intensity, quickly, yes? So it’s very different from woman to woman. The idea is that your body will know exactly the rhythm of your labor, how much you can handle and how you can handle it. What’s important is that those unconscious programs your body knows, your mind intuits, your conscious mind, your subconscious mind knows very well. What’s important is how these two get along, because in key moments, like at birth, the subconscious dominates the conscious, and then we are dominated by memories we don’t remember. That’s the key. You need to find out what memories you don’t remember you have. Because that’s where the experience will repeat itself. If you don’t bring it to consciousness. And that’s why I’m here.

That’s why my live online course with me exists, to discover how you came into the world, what programs you absorbed, how you were programmed when you went through birth, through childhood, especially up to the age of two and a half. Because until then we talk about the unconscious part, and up to seven years we talk about imprinting. For this wonderful hormonal dance to unfold naturally, the woman needs to surrender to the birth process. Exactly what I was talking about. To enter the birth trance, you need to be able to surrender. If you watched the video with the five secrets, there I explain how you can learn to surrender, with trust and calm, being connected to the instincts of birth. Because your body knows how to give birth. What’s important is that you are connected to yourself, to your instincts, and with maximum trust in your baby, because he starts this wonderful hormonal dance. How? Well, he is the one who asks for the first contraction. Very simple. He sends the information to the mother, in the mother’s bloodstream comes the oxytocin signal, it goes to the woman’s brain. The woman translates this request signal with oxytocin and releases hormones, meaning oxytocin, to create uterine contractions. Then, after ten minutes, the baby asks again. The mother’s system receives the information, sends it to the brain, releases oxytocin, creates a contraction.

So this back-and-forth or request-response becomes a dance between mother and child, which is the dance of birth. For this dance to happen, you can’t have a rigid mother, who doesn’t listen, who isn’t connected to herself, to her instincts, or to her baby or her body. You need a mother who is receptive, meaning she is tuned in. The baby is there, makes an unwritten request, the mother responds. So there is that undulation between the two. If I have a rigid mother, the baby says in vain, “Mom, I want a contraction. It’s time.” The mother is there, but she’s not. She’s turned away. That’s exactly how I was at my first birth. I was so in my head and so present and in this world, that I didn’t connect with my body, I didn’t connect with my baby, and the birth lasted sixty-three hours, meaning three days and three nights, which was pure torment, because although I had contractions, they weren’t effective, because my mind occupied everything that was happening physiologically in my body and effectively blocked my dilation and birth. That’s why it took me three days and three nights to give birth.

I hope this makes sense to you and that you can learn from my mistakes. Although I know that “learn from others’ mistakes” is just a saying. But I’m giving you some mechanisms. The more of a control freak you are in daily life, the harder it is for you to surrender. That’s why you need a mindset, a way of thinking that you take in the direction of surrendering to the birth process, surrendering to your femininity. Because if you don’t do this, things don’t progress, labor gets blocked. You can’t give birth with your mind. This is the most important aspect. The body gives birth, the baby is born. The connection between the baby and your body. That’s where contractions happen. When you give birth with your mind, you block, because you block the physiological, you block the birth instincts, you block the birth process. Birth does not happen with the mind. That’s why women with less mind find it very easy to give birth. They are not in their heads. The more we are in our heads, the harder it is for us. The more we learn to take the mind out of the equation, it’s like cutting from here up, we don’t care. Birth doesn’t happen here, we don’t give birth with the attic, we give birth with the body. We give birth with our instincts, which are not here. When you talk about instincts, you put your hand here, in that area, I don’t know, the heart, the feeling, the solar plexus, that’s where we feel. We don’t feel in our head. The head ruins things. The head has no place at birth. This is a key secret. Because this guarantees you a beautiful and fulfilling birth. When you don’t think, when you don’t involve the rational, when you don’t judge. Literally, when you don’t judge, when you are only connected to your head, to your body—actually, the opposite, to your body.

After the baby is born, oxytocin continues to be produced, because the placenta is also to be born. But this only happens if the birth continues its natural process with the golden hour. Let’s look at this picture. Let’s admire a newborn baby, who doesn’t yet have a pink color, but a reddish color that has turned from purple. Because all babies, when they are born, are purple for the first time. So there’s nothing to be scared of, nothing serious. All babies are born purple, then they recover. And you, as a mother, have the obligation and must assume that you will grant all the rights this child comes with: the right to the golden hour, the right to a good start in life and not a traumatic one, because that’s why he chose you to be his mother, because he knows you can. Even if the world, let’s say, is against you and it’s hard to find a place to assert yourself, you will find it and you will defend your helpless child. It depends on you whether the golden hour will exist or not. It depends on you whether you will put your baby to your breast in the first thirty minutes and be able to birth the placenta without IVs, without painkillers, without interventions, precisely to give this child a good start in life and yourself a beautiful birth. You don’t need to be scraped, you don’t need to be handled roughly, you don’t need to suffer. But for this, you need to know. And you are on the right path, because you know more and more things. And now...

One thing that is guaranteed to disrupt any birth is the fear of birth and the fear of pain. Because that’s exactly it, fear. What do we do when we’re afraid? We go, “Ee, I’m scared!” We don’t even breathe. And what does the body do? It contracts? Of course. When I go, “Ee!” all my muscles have already contracted and I’m in a state of alert. When a woman is afraid of contractions, because she doesn’t understand them, because no one explained them to her, because she doesn’t have information about how intelligent the body is and what contractions are for and that they don’t have to hurt. This fear of birth and fear of pain causes exactly the suffering that every woman actually runs from. And I ran from fear and fear of pain. And so I thought I would give birth by scheduled cesarean, with total anesthesia, because I was afraid of pain. And you know what woke me up? The fact that I lost three pregnancies and started to question myself, my beliefs, what I had learned about birth, and I realized I knew nothing.

And I realized that natural birth is frightening because we don’t understand it, because we don’t know what happens during a natural birth, and so we run from it. We run because we are afraid of birth and because we are afraid of pain. But when you understand your body, you understand your contractions, which actually just get the baby out of the uterus and don’t have to be so painful that you scream and shout. Because you can’t take it anymore, you don’t do it for pleasure or because it feels good. Because no one screams with pleasure at birth. The problem is that if you stay in that fear of birth and fear of pain and don’t resolve it, with what? Only with information. Only with deeper knowledge. Exactly when you have those emotions, adrenaline appears in your body, and what does adrenaline do? It inhibits exactly your hormones, meaning oxytocin, which causes contractions, and endorphins, which provide anesthesia and a trance state for the woman giving birth and considerably reduce pain.

And exactly these hormones would help you have a beautiful and fulfilling birth experience. But if you remain in a state of fear and fear of pain, adrenaline annihilates oxytocin and endorphins. And now, finally, you know why most of your friends who wanted to give birth naturally but got blocked and couldn’t, had these blockages. Because fear and anxiety didn’t trigger oxytocin and endorphins in the body, but fear, pain, and anxiety. And then adrenaline cannot coexist with the love hormones, with the endorphins that anesthetize, because they are on an opposite level. These two or three hormones cannot coexist. Adrenaline annihilates the appearance of oxytocin and endorphins. Whereas, if I am in a state of well-being, of confidence, of acceptance, and I have eliminated fear and anxiety, because now I know what my body does and what it is capable of and I am no longer afraid. Why? Look, ninety-five percent of fear comes from ignorance.

It’s simple. If you know the process, the fear disappears. Because you know what happens in the body. You know how to interpret. You know what to do. You know how to do it. And then adrenaline is no longer needed, because you are no longer in a state of “Oh my! What will happen today?” Or “What will happen at the first contraction?” Because women who enter... “Oh, dear, three million seven hundred eighty-five thousand women have given birth before, but at the first contraction, oh my, is it really that bad? Or does it really hurt that much?” Why does it hurt? Because you contracted and that’s it. From that moment, you have no trust in the process, no joy. You are only in a state of fear and fear of pain. And guess what? That’s exactly what will happen in your body because of adrenaline. I hope it’s much clearer now why those blockages occur. It’s all hormonal, all hormonal. When I am in a state of “Hi, oh my, a contraction came,” what does the cervix do? The cervix becomes rigid. The contractions are in vain, because they are ineffective. Why? Because a rigid cervix... You can try to pull it open, because the uterus has muscles that pull and open the cervix. If the cervix becomes rigid because I panicked and contracted all over, the cervix can no longer be opened and then the contractions are ineffective and painful. Labor is endlessly prolonged, and when the woman disconnects completely from her body and her baby in the womb, it’s over. She is only in her mind. She only feels pain. Everything is torment. I experienced this at my first birth. I’m telling you from experience. And it took me two years to realize why I had such a terrible experience. Besides the fact that I relived my own birth, which was close to death, to the feeling of dying, I did exactly what I’m telling you now. I panicked, because at the first contraction that hurt, I said, “Oh my, wait a minute, it’s not like the books said, that birth doesn’t hurt, so I must be doing something wrong.” From that moment, everything was over. No matter what I tried, nothing worked. The cervix became rigid, the contractions were ineffective. Three days and three nights I had contractions that bent me over in pain, but there was no dilation because the cervix was frozen with fear. Does it make sense? I hope so, because that means you understood.

And now, what are the favorable positions for maximum contraction efficiency? My dears, this position on your back—and I have an entire chapter about positions and contractions and all that—is the dead woman’s position. The woman is not dead when she gives birth. The woman has nothing to do lying on her back. No species in the animal kingdom gives birth on its back with its paws up. None, none, no mammal, no mammal gives birth lying on its back. That’s why the best positions, whether for dilation contractions or expulsion contractions, are vertical, meaning gravitational. Either standing, bent forward, or on all fours, but never on your back. Try it! During contractions, lie on your back once, and the rest of the time, stay upright or on your knees, or on all fours, and see how you handle the contractions. And you’ll write to me and tell me, “You were right. I sleep best on my back, plus you can relieve them with those breaths, with those breaths you can do if you follow the breathing course for dilation and expulsion.” So, never on your back. And how does the baby come out of the uterus? What propels and pushes him millimeter by millimeter? What propels and pushes him millimeter by millimeter outward? Well, the uterus, which contracts and pushes the baby millimeter by millimeter. Here you see the baby who still has the cervix closed. The uterus will contract to open the cervix first, then, after the cervix is open at this level, the baby slides gently into the vagina, and the uterus, with each contraction, will push him millimeter by millimeter outward.

And to help you understand how the uterus pushes the baby out, I want to explain how the longitudinal muscles work, those that are more often at the top, and the circular ones, more often at the bottom. Let’s say this is an avocado with a stem or an upside-down pear with a stem. The stem is already the vagina. So, at first, when we need to open the cervix, what will the contractions do? These longitudinal muscles will pull on the circular ones to create dilation, meaning to open the gate to the vagina. When it’s open and we have dilation, the baby’s head will enter and slide gently with each new contraction, which does what? The longitudinal muscles press, then relax. With each contraction, they press and relax. And this means the baby moves two millimeters forward, then, when the contraction ends, one millimeter back. Pause. Next contraction, from where it left off, two millimeters forward, after the contraction ends, one millimeter back. So it’s a back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth. That’s exactly what happens at birth. The baby is propelled millimeter by millimeter through the mother’s vagina toward the exit. And please also watch the course about the vagina, uterus, and the woman’s pelvis to understand how the baby advances and knows how to pass through and how to twist and how to be born. Because these are very, very important lessons.

So, how do the uterine muscles work during labor and birth? Very simply. The upper ones pull up and push effectively. And the lower ones, you see, rise and allow dilation to occur. It’s very simple. Your uterus was made to know how to do this. So, birth is that magical dance between baby and mother, like a tango, where the baby leads according to the mother’s response to his movements and requests. The more the mother is connected to her baby and her body, the easier and smoother the birth will be. Very simple. The baby asks, the mother responds. But the idea is that the mother must be in a receptive state. And not in her head, but in her body, connected to herself, her instincts, and her baby.

And now, before we end this video, I will show you a short film of what the uterus does. I will explain exactly what happens. Do you see that pink edge? I’m showing you with the mouse, and now the uterus is contracting. Now the contraction is over. Only here everything is fast-forwarded and the uterus contracts continuously, which doesn’t happen, because we have breaks each time. What you see here is the mucus plug. The uterus starts to contract, the cervix shortens. Here the mucus plug will already be lost. We talk about this in the course about the mucus plug. Here the membranes break, meaning the water breaks, which can also happen later. And you see how the cervix becomes effaced and starts to dilate. With each contraction, the baby presses on the cervix and the cervix opens, the uterus opens the cervix, and you see how these cervical lips have retracted, and when the gate is completely open, meaning we have full dilation, the baby’s head slides very easily into the vagina. Now you see how the fontanelles overlap. The baby’s head becomes smaller, it molds. Here the baby turns. Those hands do nothing, they don’t turn the baby’s head, they just catch it, and with the next contractions, after the head is out, the baby is born. And here you saw the placenta is also born. And this is the only video I found where the baby lands on the mother’s body. Let’s play it again so you can watch. So, uterine contractions will make the cervix shorten. From the movements of the cervix, the mucus plug can no longer stay there and is lost, eliminated. The membranes will break here right at the beginning of labor, but this can also happen at the end or not at all, and the baby comes out with the amniotic sac intact, but we’ll talk about that in another course. Here you see how the cervix thins, effaces, and now dilation occurs with each contraction. I told you this video is fast-forwarded, because between contractions there are many breaks, breaks where the mother feels nothing and everything is okay, so she can recover. Here the head...

It slides easily into the vagina because the dilation is complete. The fontanelles will overlap; they are simply bone plates that then reduce the volume of the head. The baby is born with a pointed head, which will return to normal; after the head comes out, with the next contractions, the whole body will come out. That is what birth means. And after that, after about forty, forty-five minutes, the placenta is also delivered. That’s about it for today. Thank you for watching, and I’ll see you at the next course.
