I am glad to see you again at this course on how to maintain lactation. Many women have this question: “How can I produce more milk? How can I make sure I don’t run out?” Yes, we will talk about breastfeeding myths, about the enemies of breastfeeding. I will show you and help you understand how to produce enough milk for your baby, when lactation is initiated, the newborn’s crying—whether it is a sign of hunger or not. We will discuss food reserves after birth and why the first feeding at the breast is the most important. As I mentioned in the other courses, breastfeeding is the most important transfer of health from mother to baby. Let’s see what the myths about breastfeeding are. (three-second pause) One of the biggest myths in breastfeeding is—one that I also knew—is that next to every maternity hospital there is a sort of general store where people buy beer. Why? Because they have heard that if you give a woman beer—meaning a woman who has just given birth—if you give her that beer, which, by the way, contains alcohol, and even if you get the alcohol-free kind, it still isn’t what you need. Supposedly, that beer will start your lactation. Wrong! My dear, lactation is not maintained with beer, nor with teas, nor with supplements, nor with animal milk, nor with water, nor with any particular diet. And I will tell you why not with beer. Do you know what beer actually does? It makes the woman dizzy so that her brain secretes more oxytocin, which, together with prolactin—these two hormones—will actually promote lactation, because milk is formed from plasma. So, we have milk because we have blood in us. We have enough plasma. So, lactation is not maintained with beer. It is just a myth. And when a woman drinks beer, yes, she relaxes a bit because of the alcohol, which reaches the brain very quickly due to the bubbles... of air. And then, yes, oxytocin is released, lactation is triggered because the baby is also put to the breast, and yes, there is milk, but it’s not because the beer made it happen. Neither teas nor other animal milk. You don’t have to drink cow’s milk to have milk, because your milk is not made from any food or diet, or from too many teas or water. Breast milk is made from your own substances, from plasma. You distill yourself to produce breast milk for your child.

Let’s see who the enemies of prolonged breastfeeding are. In fact, the enemy of prolonged breastfeeding, or breastfeeding in general, is anything that blocks your oxytocin and prolactin. So, what inhibits the production of oxytocin and prolactin, which transform plasma into milk? First and foremost, exhaustion caused by what? Hm, by lack of sleep, by stress, after a difficult birth, when you don’t know how to sleep when the baby sleeps, when you don’t know how to adapt to life after birth because you lack information. All these, yes, exhaustion can make you think you’ve run out of milk, but in fact, you haven’t run out of milk. You’ve run out of the hormones that produce milk. Why? When you are exhausted, you enter a state of stress because you know you have to feed your child and you feel you can’t. And this produces adrenaline in the body. When we have adrenaline in the body, we no longer produce oxytocin. So, my dear, please do everything you can to relax, because the more stressed you are, the less milk you will have, or your milk supply will decrease. Why? Because you are sabotaging the hormones that produce it.

Now, another inhibitor of oxytocin and prolactin is emotional shock or postpartum depression. Emotional shocks: you find out something, someone dies, you are very upset, you argue with your husband, your mother-in-law, or whoever. Emotional shocks do not help you. That’s why a woman in confinement must be protected from news, shocks, and things like that. If you had a difficult birth, if you had a traumatic birth, if you are still suffering, if you have fallen into depression—because most women do, especially since birth is not supported or encouraged. And then, with postpartum depression, yes, it will be very hard to produce oxytocin, because oxytocin is the hormone of joy and happiness. And when you are depressed, you feel anything but joy and happiness.

Lack of confidence in your motherly instinct. This is also very important, because when you lose confidence that you can produce that milk, then yes, a state of stress sets in. And by the way, those who most inhibit the production of oxytocin and prolactin are people or relatives, or those from whom you receive unqualified advice about what to do, how to do it, how to raise your child, how to breastfeed, how to hold them, how... No! Stop! No! They are your family. Your family is your baby and your partner. That’s it. Don’t listen to anyone else because we’ve seen how other children were raised. For example, yes, if your mother-in-law interferes, just say, “Dear mother-in-law, I’ve seen how you raised a child, that’s enough for me, I want to raise mine the way I want and how I believe.” And you should know that in every generation, it’s always been the same discussion. Someone always interfered. Parents always wanted to raise their children as they wished. There has always been this generational struggle.

So, there are other enemies of breastfeeding, and here we have unqualified advice. And sometimes, when you think it’s qualified advice, you might be surprised to find that the doctor or nurse telling you to pump after every feeding is completely wrong and pure stress. You’ll see that you might struggle to get twenty milliliters, but when you put the baby to the breast and have patience and are not stressed, the baby will suck and “pump,” in quotes, much more efficiently than any mechanical pump. So, mechanics have nothing to do with the emotional aspect, with putting the baby to the breast. If you watch the other episodes, you’ll understand why it’s so important for the baby’s mouth to reach your breast, without silicone, without artificial nipples, without creams, or whatever else. Because that saliva sends your brain the exact message of what your baby needs.

So, weighing after every feeding is pure madness. It’s a clear ticket to depression and losing your mind and stress, yes? And pumping after every feeding. I’m telling you all this because if you seek advice in the wrong places, you might get, let’s say, very inappropriate advice. How to have milk? Well, it’s very simple, now you know the secret. There is only this secret: stimulate the production of oxytocin and prolactin. That’s all. Stimulate this production in your brain—oxytocin and prolactin, the happiness hormone and the lactation hormone. How do you do that? Well, you prepare yourself. If you prepare, you can trust yourself, your body. You relax, you seek the support of an IBCLC specialist, International Board of Lactation Consultants. That’s what it means. There is at least one such consultant in every major city in Romania. And get your information about breastfeeding from the right sources, because that will help you breastfeed, be well, and focus on your role as a mother. And stop listening to unqualified advice.

And when we breastfeed for the first time. Well, in the first thirty minutes after birth, not after six hours when the baby is brought to you because they took them away, because the baby who needs to be breastfed in the first thirty minutes does not leave the mother’s side. They don’t go for weighing, measuring, or anything else, because it’s not necessary. If the baby is okay and breathing and has no other signs after birth, yes? It’s normal, you put them to the breast. If not, they will crawl to the breast themselves and it’s still fine. So, in the first thirty minutes after birth, the baby is put to the breast and fed. Why? Because that’s natural.

And now, to help you understand a bit, colostrum, that first milk the baby receives, is absolutely sufficient for them in the first forty-eight hours after birth and in the first two to three days after birth, because that’s how long colostrum lasts, after which transitional and mature milk come in. The baby has reserves. The baby has reserves for forty-eight hours, as long as the mother is nearby and they receive that colostrum, which is enough, even if it’s just half a teaspoon, because at each feeding, colostrum comes drop by drop, and the baby collects and swallows these drops. Because, guess how big your baby’s stomach is? Exactly half a teaspoon of liquid, about five milliliters. So your baby drinks perfectly and their reserves will help them be satisfied with that. Anyway, their stomach will grow from now on. That’s why, in the first three days, the stomach has a volume of five milliliters of breast milk. Liquid inside. Yes? That’s all there is. You don’t need more, you don’t need to overfill, you don’t need to give 10 ml, you don’t need to give 15 ml, you don’t need to give a bottle, because the baby gets their first and most important meal from the mother’s breast, with colostrum.

And now, what happens if the first meal comes from a bottle and not from the mother’s breast? This is the hardest challenge for women who take their babies home from the hospital and who later refuse the breast. Why? Because their first meal was not at the breast, but from a bottle. What is a bottle? A bottle is silicone or rubber that the baby presses with their gums. No matter how small or large the hole through which the milk passes into their mouth, the baby has to press with their gums to compress the bottle and get the milk into their mouth. So, we have this situation. The baby drinks from the bottle. From the first moment they press the bottle with their gums, milk squirts into their mouth. Question: does the same thing happen when they are put to the breast? Of course not. When you put the baby to the breast, milk does not squirt out, because the breast, especially in the first days, until it gets used to a flow and knows how much to produce and prepares itself and the milk is already there, does not need to be stimulated. But in the first days, when you put the baby to the breast, the fact that their mouth contains saliva, and that saliva spreads on the areola, the saliva sends the mother’s brain specific requests for newborn milk. So the mother produces milk for her baby’s needs. If she had twins, each would want different things. For example, one wants raspberry milk and one wants strawberry milk. I’m joking, but to help you understand the difference, if the mother has, for example, two children, one older and one younger, and breastfeeds them even at the same time, each child will ask for different milk. One will get milk for a newborn and the other for an older child.

Now, when you put to the breast a baby who is already used to the bottle, they won’t understand why, when they press the nipple with their gums, milk doesn’t squirt out. Well, the nipple is not a bottle. The nipple first needs to be stimulated. How? By sucking on the nipple, the baby stimulates it for two, three, five minutes, after which the mother’s brain releases oxytocin and prolactin, and the milk will form and descend into the breast. After those two, three, five minutes of stimulation—so milk is not stored in the breast like in a cow’s udder, but is formed while the baby is sucking. So, after four or five minutes of sucking, of stimulation, you will hear the baby stop sucking and just go tttt. Yes, I’m exaggerating, they don’t really do that. But when they start going ttt ttt ttt or fill their mouth and go mmm. That is, you hear them swallowing. Then the baby has received milk and gets milk because it has descended, and there is even a tingling sensation for the woman when the milk descends and the breast fills. So, the confusion of the bottle-fed baby is that when they are put to the breast and milk doesn’t squirt out, they will say, “Ah, no, I don’t want this. I want what you gave me the first time.” Because they learned that’s how they get milk, and it will take some patience and time for them to unlearn and realize they need to suck first, to stimulate the breast, and only after a few minutes does the milk descend.

So, unfortunately, the hospital staff are not very impressed by this and don’t care if you want to breastfeed later, and you will struggle a lot at home because the baby is used to the bottle.

Let’s see, does the newborn cry from hunger after birth? You should know that they don’t. And by the way, not all newborns cry after birth. So, my dear, if you have a baby who was born, like this one, with a smile on their face, tongue out, big eyes measuring you, looking at you, getting to know you, and they don’t cry, please, don’t hit them to make them cry, because not all babies cry. And that doesn’t mean they have a problem. It’s nonsense to think that all babies must cry at birth. The baby must be lively, have huge, wide-open eyes, and yes, they need a few good seconds to make this transition from an underwater life to a life, let’s say, without water, just with air. So those few minutes are not many. Maybe a minute at most until the baby realizes they are born and takes their first breath. They might not cry, because there’s no reason to. Most babies cry because it’s a struggle to come out and they feel the mother is desperate, unable to adapt, to manage, let’s say, the sensations of pain, and she panics. And then, yes, the baby cries too. But babies don’t have to cry. And if they do, it’s not from hunger. That’s for sure. They cry from stress, trauma, or something else, or from being startled. And most, when they start crying, hear their own voice for the first time and get even more scared, not just by what they thought. So, many newborns do not need to cry after birth. Look how wise this little friend is, how he looks at his mother. You’d think he was born a philosopher. Ha. So babies don’t cry as long as they have no unmet need or if they don’t find another way to communicate with you.

Many babies cry because their mothers simply don’t understand them and don’t understand their needs. The most misunderstood need of a crying baby is “hold me and keep me in your arms,” not “shut my mouth and stop my crying with the breast,” because that doesn’t work. Babies don’t cry just to have the breast put in their mouth. Sometimes babies need to cry to vent, to release frustration, to get rid of tension, yes?, even absorbing all their mother’s tension. So, see for yourself that it’s not as you’ve heard. Yes, thank you, and I’ll see you at the next course about birth and breastfeeding and everything else to come.
