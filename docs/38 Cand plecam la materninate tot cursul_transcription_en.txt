(mouse click) Hello, my dear! I am Ditta Depner and... this is a very important course. I believe it is the most important in terms of knowledge for you and your partner, whom I recommend should be with you during this course, because in this course I will present to you exactly the signs that indicate the onset of labor. You know, the greatest fear for men is not knowing when labor starts, worrying it might be too late, that you might get to the hospital too late, or that you might give birth in the car. By the way, if he has attended the recorded course so far, this fear of "Wow, what do I do if my partner gives birth in the car?" almost completely disappears. But it is very important for both of you to know exactly what the signs of labor onset are. Because, in the end, these are the most important things I teach. Because they help you feel calm and wait with confidence for your baby’s arrival. Actually, for the approach of your baby's birth day.

What will I talk to you about in this course? First of all, this course is based on the many years of experience I have accumulated. Not only from the perspective of a woman giving birth, but also from the perspective of a midwife assisting a birth or a doula accompanying a pregnant woman during labor. And these signs are not the ones you will find in medical or obstetrics textbooks. You won’t find them in courses about when labor starts either. This course about the signs of labor onset has nothing to do with what you’ve read online about minutes. How many minutes apart should contractions be? How many signs will you see and feel? No, it’s about something else. It’s about some secrets that only experienced midwives and doctors, who have observed births without intervening or rushing the process, know. These are signs that are very little known, especially since here, birth is no longer left to unfold naturally, but is hurried, forced, induced. And you know, and so on.

So, let’s see what the moment of meeting your baby is, and especially, how to know that this moment is approaching. I will give you a list of distinct signs that your baby is preparing for birth, because, by the way, the baby initiates labor. And at the same time, your body is preparing for birth.

If you have followed the other courses in the recommended order, please note that you should watch the course about contractions, about the cervix, about the vagina, and about your pelvis, so you can understand physiologically what is happening, so you can assimilate this information, which is somewhat more advanced than the basics. We will talk about the mucus plug. What does it mean? There is also a course about the mucus plug. We will talk about physiology, about what it looks like, what you should know, what it means. We will talk about unexpected physiological needs. About what the maternity bag should contain. And this is very important, because many women buy dozens of useless things, which not only cost a lot of money, but are also useless and will end up in the baby’s crib, which will just become another piece of furniture filled with things you won’t use. Because, if you have watched my videos, you will realize that your baby’s place is in your bed, not in a crib or stroller, but next to you, close to you.

I will tell you about all the physical symptoms that will show you that labor is starting soon. We will talk about the rupture or leaking of membranes. We will talk about what the membranes should look like, what the amniotic fluid should look like, how to recognize if there is a problem with the amniotic fluid. We will talk about uterine contractions, their role, how often they occur, how these contractions feel in your body.

I will tell you about the types of contractions, because there are several types. How to recognize them? How to categorize them? There are many questions, I know you have them. And I will reveal the secret of how to know you have reached 7 cm dilation without a vaginal exam or anyone measuring your dilation. And another secret: how to know you have reached complete dilation, again without vaginal exams or other checks. We will also talk about the plateau phase, which is very rare, but it exists, so you know how to manage a plateau phase and not only how to manage it, but also how to overcome it correctly and without disturbing the birth process.

And we will also talk about the moment of expulsion and victory, when the baby lands in your and your partner’s arms. So, this is a very important course. Therefore, please, besides taking notes, go and get your partner and come to the course, because this is some of the most important information you will receive, because after this information, you will be together, you will be a team, and you will know what to do at every moment of labor.

Let’s begin! Signs of labor onset. So, the big moment of meeting your baby is approaching. What do you need to know about your body? What you haven’t yet learned during pregnancy and what changes now, before birth, and your body is the witness. What are the distinct signs that labor is approaching? Do you know them? Besides your belly growing, besides counting weeks or months, besides someone telling you a probable due date, there are many other signs that show and indicate that labor is approaching. Let’s see what they are.

The first distinct sign that labor is approaching. Let’s see what it is. Ha, ha! You’re pregnant! Of course you’re going to give birth. This is the most obvious sign that labor is approaching. From the first day you took the test, you knew birth would follow. That’s just my little joke. The fact that you’re pregnant, that’s the first sign that the baby will come. But yes, let’s see what the real first distinct sign is that labor is approaching.

Loss of the mucus plug. What you see in the image is a mucus plug that acts as a uterine seal, meaning it seals the uterus. It is located in the area of the cervix. So, where the passageway would be, the cervix, which is theoretically closed most of the time, but sometimes opens, in this space the mucus plug or uterine seal forms. It can have many different forms and can look like this as well. So, I want you to look carefully, so you won’t be scared if you find these signs on toilet paper or in your underwear that you have lost the mucus plug. By the way, the mucus plug can be lost even during pregnancy. No problem, it regenerates.

So, this seal that protects the baby from unwanted infections—though there is little chance for infections to reach the uterus, especially since the baby is also in its amniotic sac—this uterine seal can be lost several times during pregnancy, because the movement and position of the cervix changes depending on the woman’s emotional state. And I strongly urge you to watch the course on breathing during expulsion, because there I explain what to do to have an easy birth. And I also suggest you watch the video about the cervix, because there you will find a lot of information about how the cervix changes its position and behavior. I always say it is a living organ, how it changes its behavior depending on the woman’s emotional state. I explain it much better there.

So, I found here some more pictures where you can see what a mucus plug might look like. It can also be pinkish or bloody. Yes? Or brownish. This is the uterine seal that is eliminated, sometimes without you even noticing. For example, at none of my births do I remember the mucus plug, because I didn’t see it. It probably came out during a trip to the bathroom and I didn’t notice, but I didn’t find it. So, this is a sign that can appear or can go unnoticed.

Now, depending on when you lose this mucus plug, you shouldn’t panic. For example, if you lose it during pregnancy, that doesn’t mean, oh no, I’m going to give birth and panic! No! The cervix may be dilated, and then the plug can no longer stay in place, because if the cervix goes from long to effaced and starts to dilate, the plug that was between the walls of the cervix obviously has no support and you will lose it. And that doesn’t necessarily mean, oh my, labor is starting!

If it’s before labor, two or three weeks before birth, again, you see, we don’t have a certain date. Labor cannot be predicted. You can’t know when you will give birth. You can guess, you can schedule it, yes, if you want, but then you are already interfering a lot with the child’s free will and their right to choose their birth day, not just come when you want...

So, the idea is that when you lose the mucus plug, it can still take up to two or three weeks before you give birth. But yes, it is a sign, it is a sign that it’s getting close.

Good, let’s see another distinct sign that labor is starting soon. It’s one of the signs that doesn’t keep you waiting, it is present, it’s not just your imagination: going to the bathroom for a sudden bowel movement. A pregnant woman waiting for labor who suddenly has to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement, that is clearly a sign that labor is starting. Why?

Well, very simply! Physiologically speaking, when we start an important action that involves certain organs and not others, the body focuses on that process. During labor, the body will focus mainly on labor, not digestion. So, what happens is like before an exam. If you ever had a hard exam and went to college or school, and before the exam, when you were extremely nervous, do you remember how there was a line at the bathroom? It happened to all of us. Why? The body enters a mode—yes, a mode, right?—I call it “five is life.” Meaning, when we got a passing grade, we were happy. Some were happy with a ten. Depends on what college you went to. I went to college because my parents wanted me to, so I didn’t care what grade I got, just to pass. So, when I was nervous about an exam and just wanted to pass, no matter how or with what grade, I would get so nervous that my body would go into “five is life” mode.

Meaning, let’s just get a passing grade, where what needed to be activated? Digestion? Not at all, because digestion wasn’t going to help me pass the exam, but activating my brain would. So, I would empty my digestive tract of everything digested, undigested, (laughs) barely swallowed, and get rid of everything. Why? Because in moments like these, the body reserves energy only for what is important. And then digestion is not on the list of important things at that time. Same with labor. Same when you see a bear, right? Digestion is not important. When you see a bear, most people wet themselves from fear. Why? Because the body goes into fight, flight, or freeze mode. Yes, these are automatic responses. And when the body goes into flight mode—let’s save our lives, the bear is coming—it empties the digestive tract of everything digested or undigested, just to make sprinting easier and faster, without carrying extra weight. So, it empties the digestive tract of everything. That’s exactly what happens during labor. Why did I give you all these comparisons? So you understand that it’s all very logical. Our body is logical, it’s predictable. But if you know, if you don’t know, you might think... Oh no, I must have eaten something bad. No, you didn’t eat anything bad or have a stomach problem, it’s just that going to the bathroom for a sudden bowel movement is one of the distinct signs that labor is starting soon.

So, pay attention! Many women, even after attending the course and learning this, are still surprised. Why does this happen? And they can’t believe that when it happens and they empty their bowels, they can’t believe that labor is actually starting. And usually that’s what happens. And at the end they say: “Wow, I didn’t think the sign was so distinct, because when it happened, I thought, oh, I just have an upset stomach.” No, you don’t have an upset stomach. It’s a clear sign that labor is starting. Good, so it’s a distinct sign. You can’t miss it. For example, if you have planned to leave the city where you live and go to another city, because unfortunately only there you can have a gentle birth, a birth plan, a water birth, or a respectful birth, it’s worth paying attention to these signs, because this first sign can indicate very well when to leave for that place. Yes, so, from the moment it happens, you get up, take your bags, and leave. Speaking of bags, have you packed your maternity bag? Well, it’s time to have it ready. That’s why I recommend you take a small suitcase, one of those carry-on ones, yes, not checked luggage, but carry-on, that you can take with you. One of those ten-kilogram ones, you don’t need more. Anyway, you won’t need many clothes, because clothes are unnecessary, because in the first three or four days you’ll be in the hospital, two or three days, the baby will be glued to you and will only need maybe a diaper and a bodysuit. But you’ll see and realize that I made a list for the maternity bag and more important are other things than the baby’s clothes. And definitely not little shoes and definitely not a bottle. So, this is a picture with examples of those. You don’t need this, or this, or this. And not some special hoodie or hairbrush. You’ll need those more at home, not there, because honestly, in the first two or three days after the baby is born, the baby needs nothing but the mother’s and father’s arms and to be with them non-stop. What you will definitely need is a baby carrier, because that’s how you’ll go home with the baby, in a carrier, not in bassinets and all kinds of cribs and devices.

And no, not in a car seat either. Because close to you, the baby can travel anywhere, without being afraid of losing you or losing physical contact with you. Because birth, if you think about it, is the biggest rupture that happens between mother and baby. And the baby is desperate because they know that without the mother, they won’t survive. Which is true. Because a baby, until a certain age, without the mother or without help, won’t survive, so it’s a matter of life and death. So, for the baby, the experience of birth and separation from the mother can be the trauma of their life. That’s why I urge you to also watch the course on the magic hour, to understand a bit about the expectations and physiological and emotional needs of the baby from the moment of birth until they start to gradually separate from the mother. That’s later, when they start walking and increase their distance from the parent. But until then, the baby is, how should I say, like a kangaroo, right? The mother should carry her baby, and the baby needs the mother like air. The baby is not born to become solitary or to sleep in their own crib or room. Those are societal nonsense that don’t work. The fact that some manage to train their baby to cope doesn’t mean it didn’t come with serious trauma, which will be reflected in their relationships, life, character, personality, way of interacting, insecurity, and fear of being abandoned again. So here I made a pretty broad incursion into human psychology, but the maternity bag is quite simple. And here I actually made a list of what you need in your maternity bag, and you’ll see they’re not things you’ll see in all sorts of videos from all sorts of women and moms who made their maternity bag and were paid by all sorts of companies to sell diapers, clothes, cosmetics, and other things. I don’t care what you buy or from whom, what matters is to have the main and correct, useful things, not nonsense. Because you’ll see, going to baby fairs is the biggest nonsense and the best opportunity to spend tens of thousands of dollars for nothing. I’m very serious because now any, let’s say, vehicle, yes, a baby stroller can reach exorbitant amounts, like a small car.

Good, coming back here, I know men will agree with me. Women won’t, because we like shopping. But I tell you, I was advised the same and I still bought nonsense, because I didn’t believe I would need as few things as an informed mom told me. So, it’s your choice how much you want to spend, but it can be much cheaper than you think. What do you need in your maternity bag? You need the birth plan completed in at least three copies. Why? You have to distribute it at the hospital. And by the way, you don’t take the birth plan when you go into labor. You take it well in advance to discuss it, because if they don’t respect or accept your birth plan, you’ll have to change hospitals, one, two, or five, until you find one that accepts your wishes, which are natural for a parent, right? So, you complete the birth plan with what you have decided beforehand and go to a place where you know it will be respected. Don’t go randomly, because it’s quite risky to be ignored.

What else you need are your original documents. Your original documents mean your ID, marriage certificate. If you don’t have one, you need your birth certificates. You’ll need these in original. This is required at city hall when you register your child, right? Then, if you have medical records from the pregnancy, take them all and put them in a folder and present them, because often there is an exaggeration with these medical records from pregnancy. But, if you’ve already done them until now and now you’ve decided not to do more, those are good too, showing that everything was fine and a low-risk pregnancy doesn’t suddenly become risky.

Good, you’ll also need pillows. Pillows, why? Well, if you’re traveling by car, you’ll need pillows for support. Anyway, you won’t be sitting in the front seat. You might sit in the back. You’ll need the same pillows when you return with the newborn, because you’ll need nursing pillows to raise the baby to breast level. You’ll need pillows for your own comfort. You might not want to sit as if nothing happened, after all, you’ve just given birth. I recommend you also pack some extra towels, some indispensable blankets for your comfort. Because yes, sometimes your feet get cold or you need a little blanket to feel better, warmer, cozier, you know... And towels, or those waterproof pads, are very good, because after birth, the woman enters a postpartum period, which means a kind of bleeding, as the uterus cleans itself, quite prolonged and not just three or four days, like a period, but a week, two, three, depending on how medicalized the birth was. Because the more natural the birth, the shorter this uterine cleaning period will be, sometimes just a week, after which you won’t feel any discomfort.

Good. A kit of therapeutic-grade essential oils. Be careful with oils, because many are synthetic and you don’t need anything synthetic now. I have prepared a maternity kit for mom and baby, including for the magic hour, for “Welcome, baby!”, for mom’s exhaustion, for... relaxation, for increasing contractions, for jaundice, if the baby gets it. So, it’s a pretty small kit, with a small investment. You don’t need to buy hundreds of oils or dozens to make your own mixes. Plus, these mixes were recommended by midwives and tested by me. And I have a pain oil, especially for birth pain. Fantastic, it works wonders. I use it for other pains too, and it’s great. The oil kit. Yes, it’s also for eliminating fear. I have an oil for fear that reduces anxiety and helps you have an easier birth.

Next, what else do I recommend in the maternity kit? Prepare some cotton compresses for your forehead, neck, and perineum, because I choose different colors for these compresses so I know which is which. They are very good, especially during labor, when a woman feels the need for something cold on her forehead or pulse points, or something warm on her forehead. Or, you know, on the chest... It depends. There are many states a woman in labor goes through, and it will be much easier to help yourself with compresses that can be cold or warm at the same time. I also recommend you take a thermos for fruit juices or water. You are allowed to eat and drink, so have something. Yes, I still highly recommend plasma. Quinton plasma, taken like in a marathon, because birth is like a marathon in terms of energy consumption. I recommend taking plasma every hour because it revitalizes and mineralizes you instantly. It’s very important because women, usually, through the effort of labor, lose a lot of minerals through sweat and energy consumption.

Clothes and cosmetics for you and the baby. Perineal oil, again very important, nipple cream for breastfeeding, baby diapers. I assume you don’t want to use diapers full of chemicals like those from Pampers or, you know, the well-known brands, but those are full of junk. Postpartum pads are very important to have. They are more special than period pads, because they are much longer and thicker, because the bleeding is different and won’t be like a period. Special underwear for before and after birth, because this is different from the normal underwear we wear when not pregnant. Postpartum panties, again extremely important and very practical, especially since you’ll spend the first month in bed next to the baby, trying to sleep, trying to feed in bed, breastfeeding, rocking, sleeping. The baby will be glued to you, especially in the first two months after birth, and I say this in the breastfeeding course and in other postpartum courses.

Don’t forget your camera, video camera, mobile phone, headphones, all with batteries or chargers, because yes, we need them, don’t forget them. Prepare everything, put them in a suitcase, and the suitcase should be open, and when, let’s say, the first sign of labor appears, you throw everything in the same place, close the suitcase, and leave, because you need to free your mind for other things, not keep your mind busy: Oh no, I have to pack. The bag is there, ready, you just close the suitcase, throw in the last things, and leave.

What you need is an elastic wrap for carrying the baby home on the mother’s chest from day one, even with mom in the back seat of the car. By the way, dear moms, if you are drivers, when you carry your baby, forget about driving. You will need a driver, because you can’t drive and carry your baby at the same time. This information is vital, and the woman with the baby in a wrap or carrier will always sit in the back and put the seatbelt not over the baby, but without touching the baby. It’s possible. It’s simple.

You’ll also need hydrogen peroxide and pads, because even for home birth I recommend these pads, because they are waterproof and you can use them even if you didn’t give birth at home in bed. Because lying in a semi-reclined position in the first two months, you might not want to stain the mattress. And I recommend you get a waterproof sheet to put over the mattress, then a normal cotton sheet, and then pads on top. So you’re sure nothing happens. It’s not that hard, but you definitely need special postpartum panties, which are special panties. They are very airy, meaning they have a wide coverage, but are somehow crocheted with very large holes, not with a crochet hook, but I don’t know how to call them, and yes, they are reusable. With a pack of about five pieces, you’ll manage for one birth and can keep them for the next child, if there is one. They are washable, so very practical. And get special postpartum pads, not others, because the others are not good and many are full of chemicals, chlorine, and you really don’t need to put something artificial and full of chemicals on your perineum after birth.

Now that we’ve covered the maternity bag, let’s see what the next distinct sign that labor is approaching is. Pain in the lumbar area. That is, here, in the kidney area, lower back, coccyx, pubic area, even at the pubic bone, at the mons pubis, or cramps like during menstruation. Girls who have had menstrual pain on the first or second day or in the first days know what cramps mean. I’m not saying these cramps are normal during your period, but I’m saying they are exactly like contractions, because they feel just like contractions. When your lower back, pubic area, cramps in this lower area start to hurt, it’s a sign that labor is starting. I think 80% of women go through such moments, and what I can tell you is that there is a breathing technique I teach in the course where you’ll find the two types of breathing for labor. I recommend them because they greatly reduce the sensation of pain. Even if, let’s say, you’ve had menstrual pain and have trained in this sense, I also recommend the pain oil, because this oil will reduce the sensation of pain without suppressing it and without stopping the process, because contractions continue. Even if you put that pain oil on, it’s not like a medication. For example, Nospa, which is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. And I talk about this in the birth plan. Nospa is not okay to take during pregnancy, and it’s an antispasmodic, while contractions are uterine spasms. So, in the end, what do we do? Do we stop labor or what should we do? And by the way, I know there are doctors who recommend using Nospa. At least in Romania, this medication is very popular. I don’t agree with this, because there are many other natural, simple ways to stop contractions, let’s say, before their time, or Braxton-Hicks contractions, or, let’s say, false ones. Although none are false, all are real. It’s just that women get scared if their belly tightens and don’t think it’s because of stress, but think the belly does what it wants, when actually the belly is just signaling that there’s too much stress for you and you should reduce it. But if we don’t know how to read our bodies, we end up taking pills.

So yes, I only recommend what is okay and what doesn’t suppress symptoms or physical manifestations in the body.

Good. The fourth distinct sign that labor is starting is the leaking or rupture of membranes. I was glad to find a picture where a woman’s water broke, and because she was wearing jeans, you could see what it means for your water to break. So, leaking or rupture of membranes can happen right at the beginning or not, during labor or not, or even during expulsion or not. And if not, then the baby will be born with intact membranes. And in a course about membranes, I will tell you and show you what a baby born in intact membranes looks like. And it’s possible, most of the time, if doctors don’t intervene. Many women give birth to their baby with intact membranes. That is, the baby is born in the amniotic sac. How beautiful!

Good, and now we have two notions. Leaking or rupture of membranes. That is, when your water breaks or when it leaks. When it leaks, not everything comes out at once. When it ruptures, everything comes out at once. Simple. How do you know it’s all out? Well, you’ll see your jeans soaked down to your feet. If it’s leaking, with every contraction, another jet of water comes out. It’s pretty simple.

And now, here you have a beautiful picture with a gynecologist assisting a birth, and the baby’s membranes break right during expulsion and the amniotic fluid gushes out. Guess who it goes on? Right on the doctor. Membranes can break anytime during labor. Here, the membranes break during expulsion. I thought it was a very beautiful and conclusive picture so you can understand how a woman’s water can break and that water is odorless, colorless, so there’s no reason to panic.

What else happens? And now I’ll show you some images of a natural water birth, with the amniotic sac intact. Here you see the baby in the amniotic sac, and here you see how, with the hands and helped by an adult, the baby is released from its amniotic sac, which is a very thin membrane. And this is a water birth. And by the way, the question I hear most often: what happens when you give birth in water? When will the baby breathe? Well, the baby will breathe only when the mouth or nose touches air for the first time. So, very simply, the baby opens the membranes after birth, if born in the amniotic sac, or needs help. Here you also see a nuchal cord, like a scarf, where the cord is wrapped once around the neck, like a scarf. That’s why it’s called that.

Good, and now, so you understand a bit, although there is a separate, much more extensive and explanatory course, what is the amniotic sac and the chorionic sac? Here you see only the amniotic and chorionic sac together. But both these sacs are very thin, and the membranes break or leak because the baby releases a hormone that thins them. When I hear some doctors say, “Oh, the amniotic sac broke because the baby had long nails,” I want to laugh, because it’s such a childish and ridiculous thing to say as a doctor, because the baby doesn’t start scratching the amniotic sac and has no pleasure in doing that during pregnancy, just as during pregnancy, for example, even if you see the placenta right next to the baby, the baby will never hit the placenta. But will kick all parts of your belly, when you see little hands and feet poking out, right, when it’s boxing night, for example. But the baby doesn’t do that instinctively, and the membranes break only when the baby initiates it. The baby releases a hormone that thins the membranes and the chorionic and amniotic sac, and these leak or rupture, meaning they break.

This is what the membrane looks like. This is what the amniotic and chorionic sac look like. The two membranes are here together, but they are so thin, and they contain the baby for nine months. It’s interesting how perfect nature is and how much is created without us knowing or doing anything special.

And now, okay, the membranes have ruptured, membranes, not membrane, because there are two: the amniotic sac and the chorionic sac. Anyway, it doesn’t matter, but just so you know for your general knowledge. How much time do you have for contractions to start? So, for contractions to start—not for the baby to be born, but just for contractions to start. And I’m speaking plainly so you understand that after the membranes rupture, you don’t have one hour for contractions to start or to give birth, but you have twenty-four hours from the rupture or leaking of membranes for contractions to start, meaning the contractions that will help you deliver the baby.

So, your membranes can rupture tonight at 8 p.m., and you can stay even without contractions, although they will appear at some point, until tomorrow night at 8 p.m. So that means twenty-four hours. So, this is information so you don’t go to the hospital too early, because at the hospital, if you don’t have contractions, they will induce them. With what? With artificial oxytocin, labor augmentation, induction, and other things, because these are standard procedures. So, it’s clear, after the membranes rupture or leak, you have twenty-four hours for contractions to start. These twenty-four hours are accepted by the World Health Organization, after which, of course, as a medical precaution, they will administer antibiotics against a possible infection. In some countries, you can request not to be given antibiotics unless, let’s say, you develop a fever. If you develop a fever, then yes, we have, let’s say, an indication that there could be a risk of infection. Many mothers refuse this antibiotic because it is given preventively, and I am not a fan of prevention just for the sake of it. I would only do it if something really goes wrong.

What do you do in these twenty-four hours until contractions start? Well, you wait! Be patient and relax. In no case should you continue your usual activities, but simply put everything on pause, because

The world will function just fine without you for the next twenty-four hours. And what you have prepared so far is well prepared. It no longer matters what so-and-so wants. From now on, what matters is that you and your child are well. Do not waste your energy on other things, in other places, or on other actions, because you will truly need this energy during birth. So, after the membranes have ruptured, you relax. If you happen to be in a city where you cannot give birth and you want to go to another city because you have chosen your maternity there and everyone is waiting for you with the birth plan, for a gentle birth and the magic hour, then, at the moment the membranes rupture, it is clear that you need to leave, get in the car, and head there. The important thing is that the journey should not be longer than four or five hours. Yes, about that. But here you need to decide for yourself. If you would rather be, from week thirty-eight, already in the place where you will give birth, or you take a sort of mini vacation, actually, you both take a sort of mini vacation! Or do you go only when the first signs appear? Yes, probably women who are already at their second, third, or fifth child no longer think about staying two or three weeks before birth in another city, but go at the first sign. But again, this depends very much on how you are and how safe you feel. Good. After these twenty-four hours have passed since the rupture or fissure of the membranes, I want to tell you that you still have forty-eight hours left to give birth to your baby. So, mother, as long as many of us do not know this information and allow ourselves to be panicked and influenced by medical staff who say that if you have not given birth in six hours, you must have a C-section. This is not true. Theoretically, a woman has seventy-two hours from the rupture of the membranes, that is, twenty-four plus forty-eight. So we have seventy-two hours available, meaning three days and three nights for the baby to come. As long as everything is okay, meaning as long as the baby has regular heartbeats and the mother feels well. Yes, so we are not talking about atypical cases, but about a normal, low-risk birth. After the membranes rupture, you have forty-eight hours to give birth. And, according to international regulations of the World Health Organization, even fifteen years ago, the maximum time allowed for a birth was seventy-two hours from the rupture of the membranes. Only in Romania, most hospitals barely accept twelve hours. So it is very hard to get-- not even twelve hours, sometimes you barely get six or five hours, so seventy-two hours theoretically, was what was done even fifteen years ago. And it was not done poorly. Now we are returning to procedures or methods that were done normally in the past. And now, because everything is fast, fast, fast, we rush a lot. So, according to WHO, we have only forty-eight hours, but fifteen years ago, seventy-two were allowed. I have been present many times with mothers who needed three days and three nights to give birth, because they went through different blockages, of course emotional, or unresolved issues from pregnancy, unresolved things. Consciously related to memories, memories from their own birth. How did the mother experience the birth with that mother? Yes, so there are many things to consider at a birth. And now, how do you know that your water has broken? Well, you know because the membranes rupture and leave traces on your clothes. And they rupture when the baby decides. Yes, remember, with the hormone that is released and, uh, that fissures and thins the membranes. It will be as if someone poured a bucket of warm water on you. Warm water, because, well, the amniotic fluid will always be at ninety-eight degrees Fahrenheit. And when, just like when you pee, and pee is warm, and the fluid in your body is warm. Uh, because that's how it happens. Yes, for example, the baby stays nine months at ninety-eight degrees. It's a kind of ultra all-inclusive, yes, so it's like in Tenerife, the same temperature all the time. The membranes are fissured if a little fluid leaks with each contraction, but nothing to worry about. It will still take some time before the baby is born. There are very few lightning-fast births where after the membranes rupture, everything speeds up and the baby comes quickly. Yes, slim chances for that to happen, but yes, we can take it into account, but when you know what to expect and how the body works, even then you should not panic or do anything special, but simply assist the birth and be there, supporting the baby and your body. It's very simple. And now, what is the normal color of amniotic fluid? And now you look at this picture and ask me what is there? Well, I chose a picture to illustrate what color amniotic fluid should be, and this picture is not amniotic fluid, but rice in water. You know, when you wash rice and the water becomes cloudy, whitish, like that? That's rice. Yes? Well, amniotic fluid does not have rice. Amniotic fluid only has the color of the water in which rice is washed. Yes, the first water in which rice is washed. That's why this picture with rice. So, the normal color of amniotic fluid is a translucent white. The fluid is emollient, meaning it is slightly oily, yes, odorless, it does not smell, meaning colorless, it does not have a color, and it is milky-like. That is, as you can actually see in this picture with rice being washed in water. Good. This is what a pad with normal amniotic fluid looks like, and this is what a pad with colored amniotic fluid looks like. Colored, meaning greenish, brownish. What does this mean? When the color of the amniotic fluid changes and becomes green or brown or acquires an acidic and unpleasant smell, acidic, as if the smell stings your nose. That's how amniotic fluid smells when the baby has eliminated meconium. I have a special course where I explain what meconium is. Now I won't go into too much detail, but you still have a lot to learn from the other courses, because yes, the subject is vast. So meconium in the amniotic fluid requires the baby to be monitored in case it has entered fetal distress. What does fetal distress mean? And now I want to ask you to take a picture, so you remember this and note that fetal distress means when the heartbeats are below eighty or above one hundred seventy for more than a minute. So, if we monitor a baby and monitor the heartbeat, then the heartbeats must be below eighty, uh, if it is in fetal stress or above one hundred seventy again, if it is in fetal distress. And then we don't have time, then we no longer give birth naturally. Then we urgently deliver by C-section, because we have to save the baby's life. When the baby enters fetal distress, the heartbeat starts to slow down or speed up, usually slow down, but there is also the other side, with hypertension. So, this means that the normal range for a baby's heartbeat is between one hundred and one hundred forty-five. That's the range, one hundred thirty to one hundred forty-five. So, when it is below eighty and above one hundred seventy, not at the same time, it's either below eighty or above one hundred seventy. But remember this? Then it means fetal stress. And why do I say more than a minute? Because you might be fooled. It happens and I have witnessed such tricks, because during a contraction, the baby's heartbeat drops. And then some doctors who want to finish that birth quickly will say: "Oh no, there's fetal stress, let's operate and get the baby out!" And then the woman no longer has a chance to give birth naturally, even though she is almost in expulsion or is in expulsion. What does this mean? Well, uh, during a contraction, the fetal heartbeats drop. That is, the baby's heartbeat in the womb or in the vaginal canal. They drop. Why? Because during the contraction, the baby is squeezed and pushed forward and an effort is made, and then the heartbeat changes. But after the contraction passes, the heartbeat returns to normal. That is, between 135-145, 155 or 165 is possible. So here you need to see how the baby's heart beats normally. But usually all women go to an ultrasound full of emotions and are agitated and nervous and then you can't tell if those are the normal heartbeats, because the baby picks up on the mother's stress and of course his heartbeat increases too. Good. About meconium. Not in this course, but in the course about meconium. And I have a separate one, so go there to know exactly which situations really require an emergency C-section. I return to another distinct sign that labor is starting. Until now it was about the amniotic fluid when the water breaks, how the water breaks, what needs to happen. Another distinct sign that labor is starting is the onset of uterine contractions that will bring your baby into the world. What you see here is a section of a belly, and this upside-down pear with this little tail is actually the uterus, and this tail part is the vagina. What you see here is the bladder, the colon, yes, and the baby is inside, with the head down and the legs up. You see there are some longitudinal muscles. And again, I recommend you go through the contractions course, because there I explain exactly what a contraction is, how it manifests, how long it lasts, how the uterus works, and so on. And here you see again the same uterus, but you see different muscles, the circular muscles, which have another role in uterine tone. So, a fifth, let's say, very distinct sign that labor is starting is that you feel the uterine contractions. How do you feel them? Well, your belly tightens for about thirty-five seconds, which at first repeats irregularly, even once every twenty minutes, and after a while they repeat more and more often, up to an interval of five or six minutes. So, at first you will have a contraction and twenty minutes of rest. Those initial contractions may last only twenty seconds. They become longer as labor progresses. They intensify as labor progresses. So you will feel the uterine contractions and you will feel your belly tighten. You will simply know that these are the contractions that confirm that labor has started. And now what do uterine contractions do? I'll give you a short course, because the full course is in another video. These contractions propel and push the baby millimeter by millimeter into this world. So what you see in the first image is a baby still in the amniotic sac and the cervix here is closed. This is the exit to the vagina. This is the cervix. Here is the mucus plug, and during labor this cervix opens and allows the baby to pass and slide into the pelvis. You see these pelvic bones. You already see, the baby's head has entered the vagina because the vagina is very wrinkled, it widens and actually allows the baby to pass through the vagina. So that's what the contraction does. It pushes the baby millimeter by millimeter into the vagina and out. Let's see what to do when contractions start. If they start at night, please try to sleep. That's if you are already in the city where you will give birth. If the contractions start and you still have one hundred eighty miles to get to the maternity, you set off because you won't have time to wait any longer. That's why you need to organize yourself well, now that you know the physiology. So you are in the city where you need to give birth. Try to sleep. If you sleep, it means there is still enough time to get to the hospital when you wake up from stronger contractions. I have an example with a mother who told me that the night before birth, she somehow felt like she had some contractions, but she managed to sleep and in the morning around six, when she woke up, she simply wanted to go to the bathroom. Because this is a habit of any pregnant woman: the closer birth gets, the more often she goes to the bathroom, because the baby presses on the bladder. She got up and felt the baby had descended and said: "Let's go to the hospital!" And she got to the hospital in ten minutes and in half an hour she was holding her baby in her arms, because all night while she slept or dozed, as it were, the contractions produced dilation and prepared the cervix and vagina for birth. So yes, it can happen in your sleep. It can be beautiful, it can be smooth, as long as the woman is relaxed and knows what to do. Let's see what a belly looks like during a contraction. It is tense. The belly is visible, even more prominent, and you will see that when you have a contraction, when you put your hand on your belly, it is hard, it tightens. And you will see that you feel this with your hand, because you also feel it in your body, that is, in your belly. From that moment, I want, please, for you to stop any activity you were doing that has nothing to do with birth. And I want you to focus on your breathing and relax, because this is the most important thing, to focus on your contractions, because they are not in vain. But if you occupy your mind with something else, those contractions energetically consume, let's say, all your surplus energy that should be allocated to birth. And you find yourself afterwards that these contractions are in vain, nothing happens because you are not there and labor is greatly prolonged. So why not just leave everything and focus only on birth? Especially since you know it will be a fantastic energy expenditure? Of course, yes. That's why I say, from the moment you start having contractions, please, stop any activity and focus on your breathing, on the dilation contractions. There is a special course for dilation contractions and on your relaxation, because relaxation means everything and thus you help the contractions to be effective. Good. The sixth distinct sign that labor is progressing. I established this when I presented contractions and breathing during dilation contractions. And please watch that video. A distinct sign by which the mother signals to others around her that she is in labor. With a smile on her face, the mother closes her eyes and focuses on dilation breathing. This is a distinct sign. This is how a woman behaves during the first dilation contractions. She is relaxed, closes her eyes, focuses. When she opens them, after the contraction has passed, she is cheerful, sociable, laughs, can hold any conversation. She is happy that the baby is coming and there is communication. And now how do you know that after the first part, let's say, in which she smiles, is sociable, is talkative? At some point, a distinct sign that labor is progressing is that she is no longer as talkative. The sensations intensify, which is visible to the naked eye. I will show you again the mother breathing through her first contractions. After each contraction, she is very present and talks with her partner, the midwife, whoever. Well, after a while, these contractions intensify. Look at her face, look at her gestures, look a bit at her facial expression. This is-- this is a clear sign that labor is progressing, because with each subsequent contraction, the sensations intensify. So you don't need to measure a woman's dilation with invasive vaginal exams, which are very well classified as obstetric violence or stop obstetric violence. In fact, we have a campaign to stop obstetric violence in this sense and it is an international campaign, not just in Romania. The idea is that the woman does not need to be checked for those around her to know what stage of labor she is in. You see it in her expression, and these things I am telling you, you might not hear at any other course, because people don't take the time to observe. They prefer to measure, to stick their fingers in, to check dilation, to do other things. The intensity of the contractions makes that mother become more and more focused and concentrated inward. And you see her here breathing through her contractions. You see here how focused she is and how little present she is externally. She is very much focused inward. In these moments, the woman automatically enters a trance. It is called the birth trance. It is a trance induced by hormones, by state, by her own state, because she disconnects so much from what is happening around her that nothing else matters. She only cares about what is happening in her body and... inside her body. That is why, somehow, the contractions intensify. And not only do they intensify, but the contractions make her internalize very deeply. When you see her no longer joking, no longer opening her eyes, and even after the contraction has passed, she keeps her eyes closed and is focused, I ask you one thing - do not wake her from the trance. Michel Odent said very beautifully: "Never wake a woman from the birth trance." Because you disrupt her whole process, all the work, all the contractions she has breathed through and integrated might go down the drain the moment you pull her out of that state. She has to start over. And it's not worth it, because she doesn't have to do anything else but give birth. You, as a partner, will take over all discussions with the medical staff. That is why it is vital for you to be informed as well. That is actually the secret. To be a team. You, as a man, to protect her and have her back and take over conversations with the rest of the world, so she can do her job, go through the contractions, breathe through them, and facilitate the baby's birth. That is teamwork. Another distinct sign that labor is progressing are sudden changes in body temperature, which make her become unbearable and impossible and very hard to please. I'm not joking. A woman in labor, at some point will... yell, will shout, will shout at you, not from pain, but will shout at you to open the window, it's too hot, close the door, I'm cold. Turn on the radiator, I don't like it. Blow out the candles. Turn on the light. Turn off the light. You're annoying me. Get out. Come in. Splash me with water. Give me a compress. In those moments, the woman adopts a truly commanding attitude, but not because she wants to be the boss, but she adopts a truly threatening attitude of a commander in action. This is just so you understand that it is a passing thing and that all women experience it when, let's say, labor unfolds naturally and is not induced or forced. So, dear ones, rejoice when the woman starts giving orders. This should be a reason for joy, because it means labor is progressing. When she starts to become unbearable, we already have considerable dilation. That is, six or seven centimeters, which is wow! To work to get there is sometimes hours, days of work. So, kiss her when she chases you around and gives you orders, even though you might get scolded because she is doing an extraordinary job. If she does not enter this trance state and does not disconnect from the world and remains only at the idea of "I had a contraction, how nice, it's over, how well I breathed through it!" That is the beginning of labor that is not progressing. And her body still stays there for a long time. And that means no dilation or one or two centimeters. If she does not change... Not intentionally, but involuntarily, does not change her attitude. She actually does not have, does not have dilation, but remains in that nice, nice, smiling state and so on. So, when she becomes unbearable, insufferable, very hard to please, not that she is otherwise, yes, then we have greater dilation. She will even ask for impossible things, because the poor thing does not know how to better cope with the unprecedented and intense demands of her body. You will see her yearning. Kiss her. She's adorable! I know, she annoys you to the core, but believe me, she's doing her job. Labor is at an advanced dilation, and she does not know how to cope with these challenges and body intensities except by manifesting in anger. Yes? When, for example, she tells you that she's hot, then cold, then it will seem absurd to you, but that's exactly how she feels and someone who has gone through two labors and at both had some outbursts, that I was embarrassed in front of the doula I was with, to boss her around. Close the window, turn off the heat, turn it on. I'm cold, I'm hot. Too much air. Blow out the candles. Turn on the light. Turn off the light. So I was. At some point I realized I was so unbearable and I said please, forgive me, I don't know why I'm like this. I'm not like this. But she said: "Don't worry, you're doing great. This is normal." Yes? But yes, when you don't know what's happening and you've never closely observed a woman's behavior in labor, you have no way of knowing that these manifestations are extraordinarily good and perfect. Yes? What's the good news? Well, when she starts giving you instructions and bossing you around and behaving unreal, it's because the dilation has reached six, seven cm. So it's perfect. Kiss her, congratulate her! Artistic moment for the dad. I'm not joking, because labor is progressing. I forgot to tell you. You have homework? From now on. Go to the store and buy a mini champagne like the ones on airplanes. Don't get a one-liter one, you'll get drunk. We don't need drunk parents at birth. Who recommends champagne? We'll talk about that right away. The idea is you need a small airplane bottle, but a good one. Don't get some cheap stuff from Lidl or wherever, but get a good champagne that she likes to drink. And not brandy, not whiskey, champagne... Well, when she becomes unbearable, you go and take the champagne from the maternity bag. That's why I told you that we have-- You will have an atypical maternity bag. Take the champagne from the maternity bag and put it in the fridge. Surely, in the hospital where you will give birth, you will find a fridge. In the hallway, in the room somewhere. If you don't have one, ask someone to tell you where the nearest fridge is or, if it's winter, put it outside the window, it will cool down that way too. So what do you have to do? Besides the fact that you will buy champagne these days? And I'm not joking, it's for real, it's true. When labor is progressing and she starts giving orders, at that moment you will remember. Dita said to go get the champagne and put it in the fridge. Who recommends this? A nice doctor. An extraordinary man, Dr. Michel Odent. I'll explain right away why. You now put it in the fridge. Well, not now, but then you will put the champagne in the fridge for the celebration. Good. This is a logistics thing you need to do and you will have to take care of it. So I will buy the champagne, not the woman. The woman has other concerns. She has clothes and other things. Good, let's end the artistic moment. Let's see what the eighth distinct sign is that labor is nearing its end. Oops! We're getting close to the end. So you see, the champagne foretells something nice. A distinct sign that labor is progressing from the moment the mother spends more time on the toilet. It means the baby has reached the vagina and expulsion is near. Do you remember I showed you the cervix that thins, shortens, and causes dilation, after which the baby's head can slide into the vagina? That means expulsion. When the baby's head slides into the woman's vagina. At those moments, and I explain this in the contractions course and you will understand the mechanism better there. The woman feels the need to go to the bathroom, as if she wants to have a bowel movement. But it's not about that, it's the baby pressing right on the entire pelvic area and gives the sensation that she needs to have a bowel movement. But it's not about that, it's about the position and the place where she knows she goes to do something. And you should know that eighty percent of women who have the possibility to go to the bathroom will sit on the toilet with a pillow. Like this. And here's another extraordinary example of what a belly looks like. It's not deformed, it's not sick. This is what a belly looks like during a contraction. You can actually see how the uterus works. So, when you see her sitting on the toilet, it's clear the baby is in expulsion. What does it mean to be in expulsion? The baby only has this much left to pass through the vaginal canal. This much. So birth may follow. The sign that labor is progressing toward the baby's expulsion is this triangle. You can even see the two points here. The triangle that swells the lumbar area of the mother's pelvis during labor. So, the woman, if you look at her from behind, also has a tattoo here, which points exactly to this triangle. This swelling shows you that the baby is close to coming out and is in full expulsion. Look, this is a distinct sign that any experienced midwife knows, without needing to keep measuring cervical dilation. So, my dears, besides the fact that checking cervical dilation is abuse, it is obstetric violence and inhibits and stops your labor because it inhibits you, you do not need dilation checks. An experienced midwife only looks at you. A partner who knows the signs, exactly the ones we discussed, observes you and knows what stage you are in. That's why I asked you to participate together in this course, so you can be a team. This is the sign. Here you can perhaps see the swelling better and it is called the Michaelis triangle. Yes, this is the triangle that swells, because that's where the baby's head passes, enters the vagina, and actually produces this prominence. A few centimeters and you will hold your baby in your arms. And yes, I think you can't wait. And now, for some women, even if the baby is almost in expulsion or already in expulsion, there is a plateau phase or, as I call it: the stolen nap before the grand finale. Where you see her exactly like this, (one-minute pause) the woman who is about to give birth and who until then was in a frenzy and concentration and intense labor, now you see her dozing off. That's what happened to me at one of my first births. And I really didn't know how to handle the situation. And I stayed in observation. And I did well, because that's what you have to do. If she falls asleep, because the contractions simply stop at some point, it means she is in a plateau phase. The plateau phase is nothing bad, it's just a break before the grand finale. It's as if the woman is given a chance to relax, to steal a nap, yes? To recharge with energy for the last, most intense part: the baby's expulsion. So, if she falls asleep, your beloved, if she falls asleep, it doesn't matter if it's for five minutes, ten minutes. Mine slept for over forty minutes. At one point, being the first time and never having encountered this idea, I thought, "Oh no, oh no!" If we have to start over now, that's really bad. But no one started over. Everything was very quick and after she woke up, she asked to go into the water pool and in twenty minutes the baby was born. That's what the plateau phase means. Everything freezes in place, nothing is ruined, you just pick up where you left off. It's exactly the stolen nap before the grand finale. And who gives this plateau phase? The baby! Because it stops your contractions and please watch the video about contractions, so you understand how they form, who asks for them, how they are requested, what the mother's response is, that beautiful dance, yes? You will understand that the baby gives the mother a break so she can handle the expulsion. How beautiful! Know that your babies really don't want to harm you, they really want to get through safely. For you to get through birth safely and for everything to be perfect. So trust them, their discernment, the fact that they know how to be born. The idea is not to stop them, not to hinder them, not to obstruct them. Yes, that's the most important thing. The ninth sign is a distinct sign that labor is nearing its end. Let's see what it is. When your beloved who is giving birth says: "I can't anymore, I don't want to! Leave me alone with your natural birth. I don't want to hear about Dita, I don't want anything. Give me a C-section, give me anesthesia, get the baby out." These are the sentences usually heard in a delivery room where birth has been left to unfold naturally and normally, the woman enters that moment of "I can't anymore." And I tell you from experience that at both my births, I had a moment when I said: "Brothers, I'm done, I'm leaving. I can't anymore. Just get it out! Yes, surgery? Yes, do whatever you want, I can't anymore." It's like going home to mom. Yes, it's about the same thing. So, when that plateau phase comes and she exclaims: "I don't want to, I can't anymore, I don't want a natural birth. Cut me! C-section! Total anesthesia! I don't care anymore." Go and get the champagne from the fridge, pop the cork and give her a sip. (laughs) Because, as Dr. Michel Odent explained, she doesn't need to get drunk. That's not the point. But the fact that champagne has bubbles, these bubbles in the champagne will instantly carry the alcohol to the brain, and that impulse from that sip of champagne—because she only needs a sip, don't let her drink the whole bottle, she might—so she only needs a sip, because we don't want her drunk when giving birth. Those bubbles will carry the alcohol to the brain and the brain will release oxytocin because it will enter that phase of (sighs). OK. Again. The truth is that this is the maximum intensity phase. It won't get more intense than this. When she says "I can't anymore, I don't want to," that's the most intense moment. And believe me, she's right. It's the most intense. In her mind it's: if another contraction like this comes... No, no, no way. I don't want it anymore. The thing is, it won't come, because she feels exactly when it's the maximum. And I promise you both, and I promise you, dear mother, that from there, from the strongest sensation to birth, it's only downhill. So it won't be something even stronger or even more intense. That's my promise and it's true, because that's how it is. So, from the moment she says "I don't want to anymore!", don't pay attention to her. Go, give her a sip of champagne, hug each other or I don't know if she'll let you. Be there with her, understand her. Don't tell her she's talking nonsense or not. She doesn't even hear you. Yes? But be there for her. And she's on the final stretch, not the last hundred meters, the last meter. That's all that's left. So that's the most intense moment. That's the moment for a sip of champagne and the assurance that there's very little left. And you will tell her. "There's very little left. Do you remember what Dita said at the course?" She might curse me. No problem, I don't mind. After all the curses I've received from others, this really doesn't matter. This is one of the good ones. Let her be! There's very little left. And from that moment, a wave of love will overwhelm her, because the moment of holding and meeting the baby is coming. So that sip of champagne will greatly ease that exact intense moment. So don't forget to buy champagne tomorrow. You go and buy champagne. Not you, him. (laughs) Good. And now comes the birth. Yes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Yes! You did it! This is the finale. It's victory, triumph, courage, strength, femininity, wonder, magic. Infinite capacity, intensity, tenderness, love, devotion, support, encouragement, grandeur, and love. This is what birth looks like. He always cries and she might cry with happiness too, because this moment is such a pity not to experience together, because it cannot be repeated and we can barely see it in pictures. How intense is it? No, we can't reproduce it. Look at these images, you can feel how it is. Look at his wet shirt. Look at the places where she held onto him. Look at her face, how happy she is that she succeeded. Look at how admiringly he looks at her and you'll realize what a moment you would have missed if you hadn't been there. Or what a moment you would miss if you aren't there. Another picture. And beautiful! This is the moment when you need to be together. And so what if you'll cry? It will be tears of gratitude. It will be your victory moment. The woman will feel invincible. The man will be happy that it's over and that he's alive. Yes? These are real birth photos, not what you see in movies. This is what oxytocin, love, support, devotion mean. This is what awaits you because you are prepared. So thank you for watching me, especially in this very long video, but I say it's worth it. Your child deserves it! Thank you. (three-second pause)
