Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner and today we are meeting for a course about the birth of the placenta. I will tell you about how the placenta is expelled and how long after the birth of the baby the birth of the placenta begins. I will also explain, in very simple terms, how to check the pulse of the umbilical cord. We will discuss what you need to do to birth your placenta and how the magic hour helps with this. What birth positions should you adopt for the birth of the placenta? Because, as you will see, the birth of the placenta is much easier, since the placenta is not a baby, it is not as large, and it does not have bones. I will also show you how the placenta detaches from the uterus. We will talk about the physiology of the birth of the placenta, meaning all the stages you go through to birth the placenta. How will breastfeeding help you while you are expelling the placenta? Because you will see that the placenta is expelled exactly during the magic hour, which I have a special course about and which you have already seen. We will talk about the causes of postpartum hemorrhage and the dangers of forcibly delivering the placenta. And yes, we will also touch on the adverse effects of medications used after birth, such as ergometrine and animal-derived oxytocin. Because, unfortunately, this is what is used in most births. I will also discuss a bit about the uselessness of painful uterine massage after the birth of the placenta. This is the massage that everyone in the hospital recommends, and if you are unlucky enough to have a nurse come and massage you, you might feel like hitting her. Speaking of which, I will also tell you two or three things about the postpartum period, but that is a separate course where we discuss that topic in more detail. So, please take something to write with, because there are important things you should know so you can review your notes. I will talk to you about the birth of the placenta and about postpartum lochia.

Good. The placenta completes its role in supporting intrauterine life when the pulse stops, and the umbilical cord becomes white and soft. You have an entire chapter about the umbilical cord in the course, and outside of this course if you want to find out more details. In principle, the placenta completes its life when the pulse ends. To check if the blood transfer from the placenta to the baby is finished, you just need to grasp the cord with two fingers and feel the pulse. You do not need to be an expert. You do not need a degree for this; you simply grasp the umbilical cord with two fingers and feel the pulse. It is like finding your pulse here on your neck and actually feeling it in your fingers. Only the pulse of the umbilical cord is much stronger and more vigorous. The pulse lasts about twenty to twenty-five minutes after birth. So, during the twenty-five minutes in which the umbilical cord pulses, you will have your baby on you. That is why the umbilical cord is not thirty meters long to reach the baby in another neonatology ward, but only about fifty or sixty centimeters, exactly the distance needed for your baby to stay at your chest. So, it is very simple. Nature has created perfect things. People no longer know how to use or follow these signs, which are absolutely incredible, clear, and logical.

Now, the detachment and birth of the placenta will happen naturally thanks to the magic hour. What does the magic hour mean? Exactly what you see in the image: the newborn baby placed at the breast and, yes, a hungry mother, because, by the way, after birth you will be hit by hunger. I think I am feeling it now myself. Please have something handy—hospital catering is usually terrible—so have, I don’t know, a menu from someone who delivers food. Because while you enjoy breastfeeding and your baby, maybe you will also get a well-deserved good meal. Why? Because you will be extremely hungry. Birth, energetically speaking, consumes a lot. Birth is comparable to running a marathon, meaning you have run about twenty-six miles. Energetically, you really need some supplements and food to recover. So, put the baby to the breast, and contractions will be instantaneous. The contractions will eventually expel the placenta, as you know from the course about contractions. Contractions are formed when we stimulate oxytocin. Oxytocin, in the case of breastfeeding, is produced instantly when the baby is put to the breast. You put the baby to the breast, the baby starts to suck, and oxytocin and prolactin are produced instantly. Prolactin will turn into milk. We talk about this in the breastfeeding course, and you will benefit from the contractions that will eventually expel the placenta, just as the contractions birthed your baby; the same contractions after birth will expel your placenta, meaning they will birth your placenta. A natural birth with a magic hour does not need animal-derived oxytocin for the placenta to be born.

And yes, I know, now you will say: "What do you mean, animal-derived oxytocin?" Yes, I have bad news. If you did not know, all oxytocin, since it is a hormone, is extracted from our animal sisters, from sows. So, when your labor is augmented and they want you to progress faster, you will receive porcine oxytocin. That is what they give. There is no other synthetic version from a hormonal point of view. It is animal oxytocin from sows. So, regarding this, oxytocin has the most severe adverse effects, which are listed in the leaflet. And by the way, you may have heard that oxytocin is okay during birth. No, it is not okay at all, and many doctors avoid it. Doctors who care about women. Many real gynecologists avoid giving oxytocin because the first adverse effect listed in the leaflet is uterine rupture. So, those of you who have had a previous birth by cesarean, you are already on the forbidden list. Because, ironically, you are afraid your old incision will rupture, that your uterus will rupture. No. You should be more afraid of using oxytocin, which ruptures the uterus due to the mechanical movements it causes instead of contractions. So, a woman who has given birth by cesarean and wants to have a natural birth the second time is forbidden to use oxytocin. Why? Because the risk of uterine rupture is much higher due to oxytocin, not because she has had surgery. Statistically, oxytocin is terrible and is the leading cause of uterine ruptures, not previous cesarean births. So now you know why oxytocin is not okay and is not a product that is, so to speak, good for people, even if it is used. But the idea is that oxytocin is not always needed during birth. So what should you do instead of oxytocin? Put the baby to the breast, and you will produce endogenous oxytocin. You do not need oxytocin from a sow to birth your placenta.

Now, what positions should you take to expel the placenta as quickly and easily as possible? First of all, a more gravitational position is recommended, because women usually remain lying more on their backs after giving birth, and the baby is handed over. So, you should sit up on some pillows, be helped, have some pillows placed behind you, so the baby can stay at the breast, because we need the baby for contractions. So, it is very clear. Thus, her back will be supported at a forty-five-degree angle. The more upright she is, the faster the placenta will come out due to gravity. Why? After it detaches—and I will show you an image of how the placenta detaches—it will be born. And this is what the placenta looks like. This is the umbilical cord. It is like a tree with many branches, and the birth of the placenta will not be as painful or difficult as the birth of the baby, because the placenta is a soft and malleable form, even though it is as big as two hands. For example, this is a placenta. Here we have the umbilical cord, and all these veins are blood vessels. And this is what a cross-section looks like. And indeed, in terms of size, you can hold it in two palms. So, this is what the placenta looks like. Here it is almost born. Here you have a placenta already born. The expulsion of the placenta is, of course, a second, much easier birth. And yes, the placenta will be born naturally, without hurry, without pulling on the cord or other interventions. Why do I say this? Because pulling on the placenta is dangerous. What you see now is the part with a very fine membrane, which is the side facing the baby. The other side, this is the side facing the baby. This side is much bloodier because it is without a membrane and sticks directly to the uterus. So, this is the uterus, and the placenta sticks to the uterus. When the placenta starts to detach due to contractions, which are facilitated by what? By the baby's sucking. Yes, because the baby's sucking produces contractions. From that moment, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall and slides toward the vagina. If the woman is lying on her back and not upright, the placenta will remain in the vagina for a long time, even if it is detached, even if the pulse has stopped, because it no longer pulses when it is detached; it only pulses when it is attached and alive. When it has finished its job and is no longer alive and no longer pulses, because it has transferred the stem cells and blood to the baby, it will simply remain in the vagina. And the woman says, "Oh my, I have not birthed my placenta!" But the placenta just needs to be pushed out, because it is in the vagina. But because she is lying too far back, if she were to sit up or go to the bathroom—and be careful, when she goes to the bathroom, please help her, because many women, after the effort of birth, feel dizzy and lose balance. Do not fall, because birth is an effort. Women lose a lot of energy during birth. So, if she were to sit upright, in a more vertical position, the placenta would come out in two contractions. But it is important to sit as upright as possible, to let the baby suck, to produce contractions, and then the placenta will come out very easily and without being pulled or forced. So, the expulsion of the placenta actually takes only a few contractions. The first contractions will detach the placenta from the uterine wall—the placenta knows how to detach itself—then it falls into the uterus, and after the birth of the baby, now, to understand how long it takes: after the baby is born, the pulse of the placenta while it is still attached lasts twenty to twenty-five minutes, after which the placenta starts to detach and falls toward the vagina, and in a maximum of forty-five minutes it will be born. So, it is not known exactly how many minutes it needs to detach during contractions. But after that, once it is detached and remains inert in the vagina, or rather at the cervix toward the vagina, in two or three contractions you have birthed the placenta. It is not like the baby's head. Yes, this image is very nice. The placenta is in a bowl in the bathtub. The mother birthed it in water as well.

Good, let’s see. The birth of the placenta is a second expulsion, much easier and smoother. It is important to be patient, because the placenta will be expelled at least forty-five minutes after the umbilical cord pulse stops. Know that there are many mothers who have told me they expelled the placenta in the first half hour after birth. Sometimes, after the pulse ends, the placenta detaches very quickly from the uterine wall and it happens much faster. But it is important not to let anyone pull on the umbilical cord. Why? I will tell you immediately about what almost happened to a mother when, after she birthed her baby, the doctor was in a hurry and pulled on the placenta. Now let me show you a bit. This is the uterus, like an upside-down pear. This is the cervix, and from here comes the vagina. What you see here is the placenta, which is still attached to the uterine wall. When it is attached to the uterine wall, it is alive, it pulses, and after the baby is born and starts to breathe, the placenta will give stem cells that are here—because they developed here and never in the baby's body—to the baby through the umbilical cord. After the pulse ends and the cord no longer pulses, and I can check this, the placenta, due to the contractions, starts to detach from the uterine wall and you see it has completely detached. This part was the attached part and it folds over itself. So, it does not remain stiff, it is not hard, it is malleable. Yes? And it actually falls into the uterus. And here it will pass into the vagina. After that, the uterus remains empty.

Now, the story, which is not just a story, but a real event. It happened and it was a huge scare for me and a lesson learned. I assisted at a birth where the mother had previously had a cesarean and was very happy to have succeeded naturally this time. She was holding her daughter in her arms, had put her to her chest, and they were enjoying the magic hour, but I kept noticing that the doctor kept pulling on the placenta. No, not the doctor. Sorry. I kept noticing that the doctor was in a hurry and, although the baby was out and the pulse had ended, the doctor kept going and pulling on the cord. I told the mother, because I said, tell the doctor to stop pulling, it is not okay. She said, oh, leave her, everything is fine. What could happen? Well, I want to say that the doctor kept fussing. As a doula, I could not say anything, because I am not paid by the hospital, I am hired by the couple giving birth. So I had no right to say anything, because they were clients, I was just a companion, like the husband. She pulled until she managed to get the placenta out. Only that, after the placenta came out, blood gushed out. Waves of blood. At that moment, everyone panicked. The baby was given to the father. The mother fainted because she lost, I think, liters of blood instantly, in a few minutes. The problem was that she did not have an IV line in place, because, theoretically, nothing was supposed to happen. And we were lucky then. She was lucky to have a nurse who managed to find her veins, because when you have a collapse and a hemorrhage like that, no one can find a vein. Here, where an IV is placed. She was lucky they managed to find a vein and gave her blood transfusions, which is no joke. That is how they managed to save her life, because she was on the brink of death. What happened? Well, it is very simple. When you pull on the cord, yank the placenta, the placenta, which is still attached to the uterine wall, will be yanked and this could lead to the detachment of the placenta. But because of the yanking on the cord, a piece could remain attached to the uterus. That piece, which you see here in the placenta, is missing. And it was hard to find a picture of a placenta with a missing piece. Yes? Here you can actually see the part that is attached to the uterus. You see, here there are areas that are attached to the placenta, to the uterus. And when you yank on the umbilical cord, the placenta might not detach on its own as it should, but be yanked and this piece remains attached here. Please watch the course about the placenta to understand that: the mother's blood, which transmits nutrients and oxygen to the placenta (pause), will come to the place where the placenta is attached. It transmits nutrients, and the placenta takes from the mother's blood circulation. Pause. And takes nutrients and oxygen and delivers them to the baby through the umbilical cord. At no point do the mother's blood and the baby's blood mix; please watch the video about the placenta, because you need to understand these things. Only nutrients are transmitted. So, even if the mother's blood meets the blood from the placenta, they do not mix. So, if, for example, a small piece remains here, which is torn from the placenta and is no longer part of the placenta, which has its own physiology, the mother's blood that comes and finds that remaining piece, the rest is detached, will act as a passageway. That torn piece will allow the mother's blood to leak. Let's say this part remains attached because someone pulled here. This piece will allow the mother's blood to pass through the uterine membrane and through that, through that opening. Actually, it is not an opening, it is a remaining piece, but torn from the placenta, and it will cause a hemorrhage.

So, what do we do? Do not let anyone approach or pull or do anything with that umbilical cord that is still hanging, because it is still attached to the placenta. The placenta detaches on its own. Of course, certain things can be done in emergencies, but not like this. And by the way, in those moments, if the doctor yanked the placenta and a piece remained, a curettage will be necessary, meaning they will come with a curette, like a longer spoon, and scrape and clean exactly that area, so nothing remains on the uterus. Curettage is a massive injury to the uterine lining, so I would ask you to avoid such a thing. And by the way, there is no need for someone to perform a curettage after the birth of the placenta. Curettage is supposedly a preventive measure. But if the placenta has detached and you can see it and look at it and see that nothing is missing, but if you see something missing, you already have hemorrhage, so you cannot see something missing and not have hemorrhage. So, when this piece remains attached, it must be curetted, because otherwise the bleeding will not stop. These are emergency measures, because if a woman loses a liter of blood, she needs transfusions. So, if you have birthed the placenta and it is whole, please refuse curettage, because it is an abuse. Curettage is painful, unpleasant, and unnecessary. I have fainted twice when I assisted at a birth where the doctor, after the woman birthed the whole placenta, performed a curettage, because that is what she did by default. She curetted even if it was not necessary, which is madness. I fainted twice. I barely made it out the door, feeling that if I did not get out and open a window, I would collapse. That is how much the uterus was scraped and how much the woman screamed, who until then had not made a sound during birth. So, curettage is not something that needs to be done after the birth of the placenta as long as there is no hemorrhage. But hemorrhage does not mean the bleeding after birth. And I will tell you immediately. Good, now about medications. In a natural birth, without medical interventions, meaning where no IVs with oxytocin, pitocin, or whatever you want to call it, were used, where labor was not augmented, where labor was not induced or hurried, where there was a magic hour and the baby was put to the breast in the first thirty minutes after birth, the woman does not need any medication. Neither painkillers nor medications. Did I show you in the image ergometrine or ergovit or ergonovit or ergonovine? Yes? Which is a synthetic product and causes blood vessel constriction, but has major problems related to lactation. Of course, there is ergonovine or ergometrine or whatever, which is given orally or by injection. If you are ever given it, clearly the oral version is less harmful than the injectable one. The idea is as follows. It inhibits prolactin. Prolactin is the hormone that leads to abundant lactation in the first hours after birth. If I take ergomet or ergometrine or ergonovine, when I cause a constriction of the blood vessels, my dear, when you watch the breastfeeding course, you will learn that milk is made from plasma, meaning from blood. If I constrict, restrict my veins and blood vessels, clearly there is a disruption of lactation, even if statistically it is not acknowledged. But all the leaflets say that ergomet or ergonovine inhibits and affects the onset of lactation. That is why many doctors, after birth, prefer to give intravenous oxytocin to women, supposedly against hemorrhage. Yes, to stop it. But now there are adverse effects to this ergonovine: blood pressure fluctuations, cardiac phenomena, nausea, or allergic reactions. The idea is that, anyway, the uterus needs to clean itself after pregnancy and will create bleeding that is abundant, but that does not mean it is hemorrhage. So, the fact that you bleed after birth is okay, but the fact that you are given medication against hemorrhage by default is not okay, because you do not have hemorrhage. Hemorrhage means losing milliliters, tens of milliliters of blood. And hemorrhage is recognized in other ways. And I will teach you now. Now, a well-meaning nurse (laughs) or even the doctor will come, at one point, at my first birth, the doctor told me: "Now you have to massage your belly." And I was like, brother, but I touched my belly and it hurt. He said: "No, you have to press because the uterus needs to return to its pre-birth shape, and if you do not massage it vigorously, it will not contract and return to its pre-birth shape." And I was like, seriously? Well, let’s see what the pre-birth shape is. The size of your fist. Your uterus before birth, before pregnancy, sorry, was the size of your fist. Now your uterus has just delivered a baby, so your uterus is sixty-four times bigger than it was when you were not pregnant. And now someone comes and massages and squeezes it, kneads it, it is terrible. The uterus does not need such trauma. But because there is no concept of the magic hour after birth in most maternity hospitals in the world, people have found a way to produce uterine contractions by injuring the uterus, that is, by massaging it. These massages produce some contractions. The uterus does not like pain. Pain contracts. Yes? Well, you do not need this massage. It is an extremely painful massage. Why do you not need it? Well, if you have the magic hour, you have the baby next to you, sucking at the breast. With each new breastfeeding, contractions are produced, because the uterus will return to its initial size through these contractions, but it will not happen in one day. These contractions you will feel when breastfeeding can last three or four days, a week, and it is normal for the uterus to go from this size to that size, not in one day. So, these painful massages are unnecessary and I do not recommend them. I rather recommend gentle methods that have been used since forever—women used to be bound at the belly after birth to help them recover. Although, look, I did nothing, I did not put anything on my belly, and my belly and uterus recovered just fine. And yes, indeed, in the first week after birth, when I was breastfeeding, I had contractions like during birth. And I cannot say they were pleasant, but they passed, and that meant my uterus was contracting and returning to its initial shape. So, there are many gentler ways for a new mother to be supported during the postpartum period. So, there is no need to torture yourselves or let yourselves be tortured, because it is not necessary.

Now, I have a special chapter about postpartum bleeding, because I do not call it hemorrhage, it is not hemorrhage. It is called lochia. These are the bleedings after birth, and I recommend you purchase these special postpartum underwear. They are washable, so they will last exactly as long as you need for a month, along with pads. There are special postpartum pads, so do not use regular pads. And by the way, be careful with pads. Please do not use those full of chemicals. All these well-known brands—Always, Carefree, whatever. Never ever use those, but use ones made from, I do not know, materials that at least imitate cotton, that do not have chlorine, parabens, or petrochemical products, because you will use them during a very sensitive period for your perineum. So, lochia is the bleeding that will happen after birth. Be careful with lochia that stops and restarts after a few days. Lochia should not stop. It should flow and will be heavier than a period. You will change those long pads, which are very thick, every two, three, or four hours, because that is how abundant the discharge is. Anyway, you will be under observation, whether you give birth in a hospital or at home with a midwife and doula. Yes, everyone knows what it should look like. That is, everyone who knows and works in the field knows what postpartum bleeding should look like. Now, be careful: if one of those postpartum pads fills in less than an hour, then it is indeed very heavy bleeding. Do not be scared by clots, because there will be some, but when you have clots larger than a ping-pong ball or a golf ball, then yes, you should check and it would be good to consult a midwife or doctor. Besides that, also be careful with severe pain in the belly area, more than the usual cramps during breastfeeding, because you will have those contractions while breastfeeding. But if they continue and are severe, then clearly, when breastfeeding and contractions end but the belly pain continues, something is not right. And, of course, if you develop a fever. But I have a separate chapter about lochia that you can purchase, which shows you exactly what it looks like and at how many days. In principle, in short, this bleeding is heavier in the first four or five days, then, depending on the birth, the less medicalized the birth, the shorter the lochia—maybe a week. The more medicalized the birth, with medications and all sorts of things, the longer the lochia, even up to three weeks. So, this heavier cycle after birth is absolutely normal and is called postpartum bleeding or lochia.

That is about it regarding the birth of the placenta. See you at the next course. Thank you.
