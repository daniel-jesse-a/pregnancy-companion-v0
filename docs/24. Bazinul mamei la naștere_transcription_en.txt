Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner. I am glad to see you at this lesson about the female pelvis during childbirth. I want to tell you how perfectly the female pelvis, any woman’s pelvis, is built for birth. I want to remind you how the pelvis prepares itself a few weeks before birth. There are also some hormones that become active, preparing the pelvis for birth. We will discuss briefly and in detail the anatomy of the female pelvis, the curves of the pelvis and how they require certain birth positions, and how the baby passes centimeter by centimeter through the woman’s pelvis. I will also show you that your pelvis is the perfect place for all the baby’s rotations, because during birth, the baby makes some turns inside you in order to be born. We will also talk about hands-off birth, meaning the doctor is not allowed to intervene—hands off—because there are many hands-off birth campaigns happening in the world, where midwives clearly do not touch, not because they are not allowed, but because birth does not need to be rushed, pulled, helped, pushed, or manipulated in any way. 

So, the baby is born perfectly on its own because it knows how to make all the rotations. The baby does not need help because everything happens exactly as it should. The baby just must not be hindered. There are also some favorable leg positions during expulsion, which, by the way, I really want you to remember so you know how not to position yourself in a way that narrows your pelvis instead of widening it, and there are distinct signs to recognize the progression of labor. So let’s begin. Please take some notes, because you might need this information for a sort of recap at the end.

The female pelvis is perfectly built for the passage and birth of a baby. The model you see in my hands is a real model; this is exactly how your pelvis looks. And yes, the baby is perfectly capable of passing through there. The future mother’s pelvis prepares intensely a few weeks before birth. What you see here are the pelvic bones, and between the bones we have cartilage. This cartilage you see here, at the spine and between the pelvic bones and at the pubis, has a special role in relaxing and preparing the pelvis for birth. I will return a bit later with details about this cartilage.

Now, let’s see how your pelvis prepares hormonally. There are some hormones that are released at the time of birth and a few weeks before birth, and this hormone softens the cartilage. It is a hormone called relaxin, and the cartilage that holds the pelvis together and gives it stability, structure, and alignment, softens, making the pelvis more flexible. To show you these things, I will now stand up and show you a very simple demonstration on the pelvis I have, where you will actually see the important role these hormones, called relaxin, play in the opening of the pelvis.

Now I will stand up to show you. Good. This blouse will help because it is darker in color. Here, in this area, you can actually see an upside-down heart. This is the pelvis, and this opening is the place where the baby’s head must pass through. What we have here is the coccyx, which is indeed flexible in women to allow the baby’s head to pass. This is the structure of the pelvis before birth. Now I will show you what happens to your pelvis when these hormones called relaxin are released, which actually increase the capacity and the space through which the baby passes. Now, pay attention, yes, look exactly at this upside-down heart here with the coccyx and see how much it increases. The space increases when relaxin, this hormone, softens the cartilage. Look, pay attention! Wow, what happened? That heart opened up and the space is much larger. Once again, do you see the heart? Now it has opened. Correct? To help you understand better, I will now place the baby’s head and push it through. Now I am pushing, but the head does not pass. However, when the pelvic bones widen, now I push, yes? The baby has passed. I will repeat once more. Let me give birth to it (laughs). There. I will repeat now, from this point of view—wait, I can’t. Oops! So we have the baby’s pelvis and look, I am actually pushing it. When it is closed, you see I pushed it here, so I am not tricking you. It really does not pass. Here I have already pushed the coccyx, but I keep pushing and it does not come out. When I open it, the baby’s head passes.

So it is very simple. The coccyx gives it direction, the spine gives it that upward direction. But if the pelvis is not relaxed, it does not pass. Look, I am pushing. Yes? It does not pass. When I let go, it passes. Good. That was a very simple demonstration showing how well our pelvis knows how to prepare itself with the help of these hormones.

Good. The expulsion of the baby through the pelvic bones and how the woman’s body knows to create extra space. I just showed you. Here you can see the coccyx again. Here you see the closed pelvis and the baby waiting to be born. Now I want to show you what the female pelvis looks like and what I could not show you live, because, well, it is not very visible, but in this drawing it is perfect. What we see here is a sectioned pelvis. Here we have the pubic bone, and here we have the spine and coccyx. This last part here is flexible. As you can see, this curve of the spine is like a slide. This slide shape positions the baby so that it can easily glide between the mother’s pelvic bones. So the baby actually has to make this curve, which is given by the slide of the spine.

Now the mother’s pelvic bones open and create extra space. Exactly what I showed you in the previous demonstration. About two or three weeks before birth, so the baby can pass easily during birth. Now, two or three weeks before birth, you might feel like (sigh) you are falling apart. It’s as if, when you walk, you no longer have that firmness where your pelvis was solid and had a fixed shape, but it starts to become like something that is coming apart, opening up.

At least with my first child, I think also with the second, but with the first I remember very well, I actually felt that when I walked, I was not as sure of myself. That’s why I want to ask you one thing: at those times, about two or three weeks before the wedding—almost said that, I meant before birth—please do not wear high-heeled shoes, because you will sprain your ankles. Why? These relaxin hormones do not only relax the pelvic cartilage, but all the cartilage in all our bones, including the ankles. If I were to wear high heels or even ballet flats, I might sprain my foot even in flats with a normal, flat sole, without a heel. Why? Because when I step, I no longer have that certainty that I am stepping firmly, but it is all wobbly because of those hormones that make the cartilage more flexible, softer, and no longer give the pelvis that kind of firmness. So, be careful, about two or three weeks before birth and until birth, do not wear heels, because you might break your neck, because you will fall, given how unstable the cartilage in our feet becomes.

Good, let’s move on. You see, the baby is turned with its back to the mother’s belly and slides with its forehead on that slide that has the shape of the spine with the coccyx at the end. So the baby will pass the pubic bone and will rest its head perfectly. Look, it even has the shape of the spine, sliding into the mother’s pelvis, pushed by uterine contractions, which propel it millimeter by millimeter. So, the baby actually slides down the slide with its forehead forward, with its head, somehow it goes like this and comes out, and here you see the stages of the baby’s expulsion. Here you can already see the head, it is actually visible at the vulva, it is arriving, it is coming.

Here you see it has already passed the pubic bone and can flex its head, which it will do because it needs to come out. See, the head is perfectly on the bony curve. And here will be another very intense moment, when the baby’s forehead will flex, because the head is already coming out. What you see here is the expulsion. So, when the baby reaches the coccyx with its forehead, the head is already visible outside, and in one contraction, probably in two or three contractions, it will be out completely. Because these things happen with each new contraction. The baby never explodes out. The fact that it stays like this for a minute helps the perineum to stretch and allow passage. And yes, this is natural. This is how tears are avoided, because if it happened all at once, the skin would not hold. And the perineum would tear. But the fact that we do this gradually is exactly what is needed. And here it is very important for the woman to know how to breathe. Because if she strains, she does not help the baby. So, please, purchase the breathing course, because it will be very useful to you then, during birth, for an intact perineum at birth.

Now, the pubic bone forces the baby to flex its head. And here, the mouth is already born and the neck is, yes?, right there. What does it mean when the baby is born in this position? All babies are born like this. Few come differently. Birth otherwise is much more complicated, because it cannot flex its head, because, you see, there is a specific position it must come in for this to happen. And the baby simply knows how to do this. Now, from that position where it came out like this, it will make a lateral twist, let’s say another fifteen degrees. So, from the head coming out like this, it will turn to one side. The baby just needs to be caught at birth, so it does not fall on the floor. But no one should be holding it with their hands to turn or rotate it. The baby makes that rotation perfectly on its own, because, you see, it has to pass the shoulder by the coccyx.

So the baby must not be touched. That’s why I mentioned hands off. When I say hands off, it means no hands at birth. The hands are just there to catch it. I could not find another image because you do not want to know what kind of images you find when searching for birth images. Only those where the midwife or doctor puts their hands, pulls, pushes, and so on. I could not find another image, otherwise I would have shown you another one. But the baby does not need rotation and anyway, you could not help by turning its head. It would be like trying to break its neck and its body must follow, no. The baby makes this twist on its own. So it will turn sideways to get the shoulder out and will be born at the next contraction. All these maneuvers, when the baby is held by the head—ha-ha, not by the head, but by the shoulders—are absolutely dangerous for it and can cause physical trauma to the mother. So, the baby only turns when there is a contraction. If the doctor pulls the baby when the woman does not have a contraction, if they turn it, if they turn its head, if they break its clavicle—it can happen. So many things can happen that it is best for no one to touch the baby. And you can request this in your birth plan, to let you give birth and not for them to do the maneuvers they were taught to do.

Now, how does the pelvis open at birth? Because I showed you how it actually opens so you can give birth easily, due to these hormones. But there are also positions that favor a perfect opening of the pelvis. So, please, take your phone and take a picture. And I want you to practice this position with your legs actually flexed in this way, because this is the position you should never do, because it actually closes the pelvis and is not the position in which the pelvis opens. So, if someone tells you to stay like this, do not, because it does not help you. The demonstration there shows that the pelvic bones narrow when you flex your knees and move them in and put your feet like this, and the baby has no way out. But if you spread your feet and bring your knees together and move your feet as far back as possible, then look how the pelvis opens and the baby passes, and I will show you again. See here how closed the pelvis is. Even though you think you have spread your legs—women give birth with their legs apart, sometimes on those things when they are on the delivery table—but it does not help. The pelvis opens when you bring your knees together and move your feet outward.

Please practice. Please take this picture and practice exactly this position. Yes? When you give birth, bring your knees together but move your feet back to open your pelvis and allow the baby to pass as quickly as possible. So, how can the pelvis open at birth? Exactly in this leg position.

So, you know what to do? Please, take a picture so you understand that this is what you need to do when you give birth. Now, there are some signs, and I recommend you take another course—it lasts an hour and a half—in which I explain in detail all the signs that show you what stage of birth you are in. It is a separate course and it is not just full of information, it is gold, because no one teaches you what the signs of birth are without checking with fingers, without doing vaginal exams, without someone wanting to measure dilation. These are the secrets of experienced midwives who have attended hundreds of births and who have realized, from the reaction and behavior of the woman, what stage of birth she is in.

I really recommend you watch that video together, because the man has an extraordinarily important role, especially in offering and maintaining that environment in which she can go through labor without having to have discussions or deal with all sorts of things.

So, this sign, you see the triangle, is called Michaelis’ Triangle. Yes? This is a sign that there is not much time left and the woman will soon be in the expulsion stage. It is the triangle that swells in the lumbar area of the mother’s pelvis during labor. It shows that the baby’s head is already there and will soon descend for expulsion. It is the distinct sign that any experienced midwife knows, without anyone needing to keep measuring cervical dilation.

Here you can see that triangle very well, yes, the two, let’s say, dimples, yes, that form that triangle. Here you can already see that the baby is in expulsion. It is called Michaelis’ Triangle. Here again you see it as a swelling. And yes, the lesson about the perineum during birth is coming up, so please stay tuned and watch the next video as well. Thank you.
