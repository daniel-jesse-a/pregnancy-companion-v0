May your heart be well, my dear! I am Dita Depner, and today I want to talk to you in this course about how to manage contractions and how they can be measured, so that you can understand where you are at the moment of birth. In this course, we will talk about the baby's journey from the uterus into this world. I will tell you about how the cervix opens and what the stages of opening are during uterine contractions. We will discuss dilation contractions and what dilation means, because many women confuse dilation with episiotomy and other things that they have not managed to integrate. I will also show you, in pictures and charts, what dilation means and where the cervix is. I will give you examples of dilation and how dilation is measured and how it should not be measured, because it seems it is not that useful and it seems to induce quite a lot of fear and, let's say, false expectations, and this is what experienced midwives around the world say. And what a dilation check consists of and what it involves, so that you are not disturbed during labor for exactly these reasons. We will also talk about the emotional causes of labor blockage, because most of the time, women do not understand why their labor stalled at some point. Dilation is blocked because, as you will see, emotions actually make labor flow smoothly or not. We will talk about contractions and what expulsion contractions are, which push the baby out of the uterus. How frequent are contractions during expulsion? We will also talk about the Ferguson reflex, as there is a reflex that helps you give birth to your child. How do you push during expulsion contractions? How do the uterine muscles work during labor? And I will also show you what the belly looks like during a contraction, so you can better understand the physiological process. So, let's start with this information about how to manage contractions.

What you see in these images—and I will show you with the mouse—this is the cervix, which here is already dilated and allows the baby to pass from the uterus, where it has been for nine months, sliding into the vagina. The vagina is a few centimeters long and must be traversed. In fact, let's say this is the most intense period of labor, right before birth. The cervix, or cervix as it is medically called, is located inside the vagina and is the first gateway before the baby slides into the vaginal canal. The cervix is initially closed, then, through contractions, it dilates and forms an opening, that is, the passage from, let's say, the intrauterine part to the extrauterine part, outside the uterus. So, in a way, it is the gateway to this world, the first gate. As I was saying, when the cervix or cervix—here you can see, this is a section, yes, here you can see the lips of the cervix. It's a circle, yes, sectioned, that's why it looks like this. The cervix retracts, and when, let's say, here we have a closed cervix. From the moment dilation begins, the cervix retracts laterally, forming that opening through which the baby will slide into the vagina and will have a few more centimeters to go before being born. So, the lips of the cervix retract and open to allow the baby to pass and to allow the baby to be born.

And now. How do contractions open the cervix? Well, contractions, as I said, are rhythmic. They occur from time to time, depending on how early or advanced labor is. When there is this rhythm, the rhythm intensifies hour by hour, so that labor starts and achieves that gradual dilation. What is the rhythm? You should know that from woman to woman, this rhythm is very different. Some women need hours to dilate. Others can, let's say, we call them langs将. Some women may need just one night or a few hours to dilate. It depends on how they actually experience labor and, especially, how relaxed they feel. The more relaxed the woman is, the faster her body’s rhythm in managing these contractions. The rhythm is set by the baby. The baby signals the mother's body the need for contraction. The mother releases hormones, causing that contraction, and depending on how this communication, this dance between mother and child, between child and mother, happens, the rhythm intensifies. Contractions become more frequent and labor progresses. If, for example, I have a mother who is scared, who is afraid that the pain is starting or doesn't know what birth is, doesn't know what to expect, the rhythm will not intensify because the body will resist. How? By being contracted from fear. It's in that state of "Oh my, it's going to hurt, what's going to happen?" and so on. The more relaxed the woman is, the better her body and the baby will do their job.

So, how do contractions open the cervix? Gradually and rhythmically, millimeter by millimeter, at the pace best tolerated by the relaxed and confident mother's body and in the optimal way and time for the baby's birth. So, not only does the woman set the rhythm, but also the child. But it is a deep and close collaboration. So, why did I tell you in another video about the connection that must be very deep with your body and your baby? This is the only thing I want you to remember. You need to be connected with yourself and your baby throughout labor, because this is the key. If you are deeply connected with your body and are introspective and feel your contractions and feel the rhythm and feel the connection with your baby, things will unfold much more easily, more smoothly, more gently.

And now, what do we have here? Here is the cervix, the vagina below, and... we see a long cervix. This is the cervix, let's say, maybe before birth or during pregnancy. This does not mean that if you do not have a long cervix, the baby would have problems or be at risk of birth. No! The cervix—we will talk more about the cervix—manifests depending on your emotional state. The cervix can shorten, as in this image, yes? From a long cervix, it can become a short cervix, then it can become an effaced cervix, meaning nothing hangs in the vagina anymore, as with the shortened or long cervix. Then dilation begins. Here we have an almost complete dilation and, believe me, the centimeters do not matter. I know everywhere it says ten cm. No one comes in with a ruler to measure. There is almost complete and complete dilation, when the lips of the cervix retract and no longer—and give a clear path for the baby to slide into the vagina. That is what dilation means.

So, cervical dilation happens inside the vagina. It has nothing to do with the perineum. This is to help you better understand that it has nothing to do with episiotomy or other surgical interventions that actually mutilate the female genital organs. So, the cervix, during contractions, knows how to retract, shorten, efface, meaning nothing hangs in the vagina anymore, dilate, and achieve complete dilation so the baby can slide into the vagina.

So, this advancement, millimeter by millimeter, is also favored by contractions that gently push the baby toward the exit. Good. Let's talk about the contractions that produce cervical dilation. This is the first point. This is, let's say, the first goal of labor. The contractions that produce dilation. Why? If the cervix remained closed, as you see here, where the blue arrow is, the cervix is closed. Here we have the vagina, yes? With the exit. Sorry. Here we have the bladder and here we have the colon. All these areas will be compressed, that is, squeezed, by the baby's body as it slides into the pelvis and is born through the vagina. So, if we had a closed cervix, the baby could not be born. So, the first goal of labor is to cause cervical dilation. So, the first part of labor will produce contractions that will dilate the cervix. These are the contractions that at first are very gentle. For some women, even unnoticeable, because they can happen even during sleep. I have many examples of women who experienced cervical dilation while sleeping or in a state of sleep or drowsiness. They are not bothersome, they happen very gently, and the more relaxed the woman is, the more easily and beautifully the cervix opens, without pain sensations. Dilation contractions, yes, cervical dilation contractions, last between twenty and a maximum of thirty seconds and occur at decreasing intervals, let's say, from half an hour to twenty minutes, eighteen minutes, fifteen minutes, thirteen minutes, twelve minutes, ten minutes, down to three minutes. This is, let's say, progressive. The progress of dilation, the progress of labor. So, as labor progresses, contractions become more frequent.

And now the minutes do not matter. Please, do not download a labor measuring app and contraction measuring app. Why? By timing on your phone, you actually disrupt your entire connection with your body, because you leave your body and enter your mind. The mind does not help you give birth. And by the way, this was the first mistake I made when I gave birth to my first child. I was constantly in my head and mind, measuring. At that time, there were no contraction measuring apps, so I wrote them down on paper. I looked at the clock, timed to see how long the contraction lasted. Then, after the contraction ended, I started counting the minutes between contractions. So, madness. Then my contractions, after five minutes of such timing, disappeared. Why? Because my mind was so activated that my body and the baby's communication with my body effectively lost connection.

So, dilation contractions, if someone wants to measure them, let your husband do this, because he can download this app from the internet and can measure the contractions. But let him not take you out of your trance, let him not take you out of your connection with your body. Let him not take you out of your rhythm in which you breathe. And I will teach you to breathe during dilation contractions, so that you do not get lost in calculations, in your mind, in reasoning, in judgment, and in the idea: "Oh my, if now it was at one minute or three minutes or fifty minutes apart, what happens?" The mind can only disrupt the labor process. This is very important. The mind disrupts birth. Take the mind out of the equation. Connect to yourself, your body, and your baby, and labor will progress. The more you are in your mind, the more labor is blocked.

Let's see what dilation contractions look like. Here we have a long cervix. Here we have an already dilated cervix. Here we supposedly have five cm. Honestly, (laughs) I don't know the difference between five and ten, but it doesn't seem so. And here we supposedly have ten cm. The idea is, don't worry about centimeters, because birth is not mathematics. Cervical opening contractions are rhythmic movements of the uterus, which pull on the circular uterine muscles to open the gateway to the vaginal canal. The circular uterine muscles are the muscles that held your baby. It is a sphincter, yes? This sphincter, the cervix, will open, and the longitudinal muscles will pull on those circular muscles, opening that sphincter, that is, the gateway to the vaginal canal. The contractions are rhythmic. These uterine muscles will open gradually through these contractions. And the more relaxed the woman is, the more easily the muscles will do their job, without acute pain sensations. So, relax and leave the phones aside. Leave distractions because you need to be connected to your body and your baby.

Let's see what dilation or cervical opening looks like, so you can get a mental image of what a centimeter means. Well, a centimeter here means a blueberry. Two centimeters here, let's say, a grape. Three centimeters, a strawberry, banana. Five centimeters, we have a lime. Six centimeters, a kiwi, a good-sized one. Seven, we have a pear. Eight centimeters, we have an apple. Nine centimeters, we have an orange, and ten centimeters, know that it is not a watermelon. I don't know exactly what fruit it is. We kept arguing here about what kind of fruit it is, but ten centimeters is definitely not a watermelon. That's for sure! No matter how small, a watermelon is huge. You do not have to push a watermelon through there, but a baby's head, and the baby's head molds, shrinks. Why? Because it sharpens. So, we will discuss this sharpening of the head. But yes, in this picture, you will definitely not give birth to a watermelon at ten centimeters.

And now, how is cervical opening measured? With fingers, yes. You will feel this if you go to the hospital too early and the cervix is still dilating. What you see here in the first image is not a real cervix, it is a dummy, but it is a kind of doll that shows you how it should be, and this is a cervix that is still long and closed. As labor progresses, the cervix opens, and the doctor might check the opening by inserting two fingers into the cervix. And then we have, let's say, dilation. At complete dilation, which is here in this image, this white part is the baby's head. As I said, nothing is real. These are plastic images, yes? Well, when the baby's head is pressed against the cervix and is almost born. Here we have complete dilation, and the baby's body will be propelled by the uterus through contractions, to come out millimeter by millimeter.

So, how is cervical dilation measured? With fingers. However, an experienced midwife does not need to check the woman to know the cervical dilation. And another secret—I will teach you to know without inserting fingers, without someone telling you what dilation you have, I will teach you to know what stage of labor you are in, without measuring cervical dilation. And now, this measurement is arbitrary, because you may have thin fingers, like I do. Or you may be a male doctor and have fingers twice as thick as mine. And you say, two fingers, two centimeters, two fingers wider apart, four cm, and then you can spread them like this, yes, to get an idea of how open the cervix is. The idea is that you will not take your fingers out and put them on a ruler to measure. You will insert your fingers into the vagina, as a doctor. You will see how much fits there and say, Ah, four cm. If someone else comes and measures the dilation, which again seems to me like rape. So, women who go to give birth and are checked by five or six doctors and three midwives and another seven residents... That is called rape and it feels like rape, because measuring dilation during contractions hurts. So, there is no need to keep being measured like objects. The later you go to the hospital, the less that dilation will be measured, because if we have a head here, it is clear that dilation is complete and no one needs to insert fingers to open or insert fingers, which hurts and inhibits me. So.

Cervical dilation is a kind of estimation, like how wind used to be measured in the past. Well, it's a joke, and you could see where the spit goes. Whatever. But that's how we measure dilation, because we insert fingers and think—uh, three. Then someone else comes and says: Ah, no, five! Well, think about the psychological impact. If you had a day where, let's say, you had sporadic contractions, repeating once an hour or once every half hour, then they calmed down, then you slept, then you had contractions again, and in the evening you want to know your dilation and someone comes and says: Oh, you don't even have 2 centimeters. Well, doesn't that demoralize you? Of course, it demoralizes you in the sense that you'll say: Wow, if I dilated two centimeters in 24 hours, that means I have many days, ten until complete dilation. My dears, birth is not mathematics.

So, measuring the cervix is something that gives you no result. And even if you had six centimeters dilation, you never know when you will give birth, because labor can progress only depending on how connected you are with your baby and how your body responds to your baby's needs. So yes, what we are talking about, we never know how long it will take, how quickly it will dilate, how much it will block or not. Because it's not mathematics. It doesn't matter if the book says one centimeter per hour. The book is a book. We are not robots, we don't all dilate the same, we don't all give birth in the same minutes, hours, and so on. We are not the same. We cannot measure something incomparable in the same way. Does it make sense? So, measuring dilation does not help you determine when you will give birth. You might already be dilated two centimeters constantly from the sixth month of pregnancy. But that doesn't mean you will give birth tomorrow. You might give birth when your due date comes, because the cervix is not always closed, open, long, short, shortened, effaced, or dilated.

And now, surprise! Exactly as I said. Cervical dilation does not matter. The opening does not predict or show you when the baby will be born. So, no matter what you are told, it is not conclusive. It's as if the doctor says: Ah, two centimeters. He would have to be Mafalda to tell you when and at what time you will give birth. Because it does not depend on him and it does not depend on calculations. It depends on your mental state, the collaboration between the baby and the mother, with you, your hormonal state, how well your body responds, how relaxed you are, your emotions, your fears that should not be there. So, it does not matter how dilated your cervix is, it does not matter. In fact, in a course I had a group a few years ago, where we remembered a song: It doesn't matter how long your hair is, what matters is how and what you think. Well, it doesn't matter how dilated or how long or short your cervix is, what matters is how you feel in labor, yes? So, cervical dilation does not matter. Surprise! This is exactly what thousands of midwives who attend births say and who never see two births alike.

And so what if your cervix is four centimeters dilated? Or what if you have no dilation and your cervix has contractions? It doesn't matter. No one can predict when you will give birth. Only the baby knows. Your body knows, and you will know when the time comes. Dilation checks are painful, because they inhibit, block, and close the woman. What does the doctor do? During a contraction, he inserts two fingers and simply assaults the cervix. When you have a contraction and the doctor inserts fingers into the cervix, it will hurt. I am not telling you this to create another fear. But if someone wants to, let's say, measure your cervix, ask them to do it when you do not have a contraction, not when you have a contraction, because then it is very painful, and that pain, when you contract—because with pain we contract and almost don't even want to breathe from the pain, yes? That inhibits, blocks, closes, tightens. So, we have no reason to want to block ourselves, to close ourselves, because someone wants to measure our dilation. Let them be healthy! We are not interested in what the dilation is. Anyway, the process will progress.

Now, of course, there are key moments in labor where, out of fear, the woman does not dilate and doctors need to see how dilation is progressing to make some decisions. I do not dispute those moments. But when labor is working, is smooth, progressing, there is no need for the woman to be checked every hour to see where she is. Because that inhibits, that blocks her the most. And now, dilation blockage has one hundred percent emotional and physical causes. Why physical? Because when you, as a resident, come as the fifth person and want to check a woman by inserting two fingers into her vagina—Do you know what that's called? Rape. Do you know what happens during rape? The woman closes up. The woman tightens. The woman no longer gives birth. Because you assaulted her, you abused her.

And the emotional causes that lead to dilation blockage are very much from what she experienced at her own birth. So, emotions block. When you have a strong fear, it's still an emotion, that blocks dilation. Obstetric violence blocks dilation. How is it, for ten residents to come and stick their fingers in your vagina? How is that? I mean, what are we talking about? What consent are we talking about? But about—I am not a dummy for ten people to come, stick their fingers in my vagina, and tell me or learn how to measure dilation. Let them measure dilation on someone who allows it. I do not allow it. Because I do not think it is normal. And a woman, that's exactly why she no longer wants to give birth naturally, because all these treatments, which are done without her consent, especially in Romanian hospitals, humiliate her, insult her, make her feel—I have no words. And dilation blockage happens one hundred percent because of the emotional. Emotional or physical. So, when we assault the woman, the woman no longer gives birth. And yes, I want to draw your attention. All of you who have suffered physical, verbal, sexual abuse during childhood or later, please, please, resolve them, heal them, because these will become complications at birth. I guarantee you, abuse turns into complications at birth. Why? Because memories overlap there. It is the same vagina that must give birth to the child. It is the same vagina that was assaulted. It is the same woman who was assaulted physically, psychologically, emotionally, sexually. Do not let these things come with you to birth, because they turn into complications.

Yes, it is a very sensitive subject and that is why there are so many problems. That is why women are actually scared of birth, because they unconsciously remember abuse and then consciously manifest blockages.

Let's talk about the second part of labor, which consists of the descent and sliding of the baby into the vaginal canal. This descent, which is also propelled by uterine contractions, activates expulsion contractions. From the moment the baby enters the vagina and traverses the vagina millimeter by millimeter, these contractions, to be more efficient and not keep the baby too long in the narrow vaginal canal, become longer and last more than thirty seconds, let's say up to forty-five, fifty seconds. The baby's body will make a smooth descent, massaging millimeter by millimeter, through a gentle back-and-forth movement in the mother's vaginal canal, which thus opens easily. Good. The first to massage and open the way is the head. The baby's head, as you can see in this image, has fontanelles. The baby's head in the womb is not yet fused, so these fontanelles are like bone plates that, under pressure, overlap. They will no longer be side by side, but overlap, creating a much smaller circumference of the skull. You see, this part goes inside. This part compresses underneath, and the circumference of the skull is greatly reduced. And here you see better. The fontanelles reduce the circumference of the head, and when the head enters the vagina, it becomes pointed to pass more easily. And that is why nature does not fuse these fontanelles. By the way, the fontanelles fuse after the age of two. So, please do not start with psychoses that you need to supplement with who knows what vitamins for the fontanelles to fuse. No. It is normal and physiological for the baby's fontanelles not to be fused until two years old. If they fuse too early, we have anomalies. Let nature do its job. Nature knows what it has to do. The baby does not need supplementation from the moment it is born. It's as if we say: "OK, until now, baby, well done for developing nicely. From now on, we take over. We have to stuff you with all sorts of things." No, that's not the case. In most cases, it's not the case.

So, the baby's head enters the vagina, and with each contraction, it advances two steps, then, when the contraction ends, it takes one step back. So, how does the baby move and advance? Two steps forward, then when the contraction ends, one step back. Two steps forward, at the next contraction, one step back after the contraction passes. This gradual back-and-forth massages the vagina millimeter by millimeter, so that the baby's skull and body advance without causing injury. The baby does not tear the woman when being born. The baby is so careful, so respectful of the mother who received and will give birth to him, that you cannot imagine. The baby does not want to cause havoc. People cause havoc by rushing labor, augmenting it with oxytocin, speeding it up, pulling the baby, pushing the baby. That is where disasters happen. Most birth problems happen at medicalized births. Do not forget this! A physiological birth, where neither the mother nor the baby is touched, but the mother receives support and is sustained, are the most beautiful, fastest, smoothest, gentlest births. Because that is how it should be. Birth is not "come on, come on, faster, we have to leave." No, birth is exactly at the pace needed.

During expulsion, contractions become more frequent. They can even occur at one-minute intervals, followed by a pause. The pause between contractions is restful for the mother, because then she feels no pain. And here you see some birth or labor positions in which the woman, as you see, in none of the pictures is lying on her back. Why? Because lying on your back is the position of the dead. A free woman in labor moves and settles into the most comfortable positions for her. Supported, squatting, supported by her partner, sitting on a birthing chair or on a toilet, maybe kneeling, on one knee or both knees. This is a very comfortable position, especially in the birthing pool, where you don't have to sit on something hard, but can use pillows or (blows) the pool... Usually, the bottom of the birthing pool is padded and soft. So, the woman never lies on her back during expulsion. And what I want to tell you is that, whether you are in cervical dilation contractions or in expulsion...

You will only feel pain when there is a contraction. Otherwise, during the pause, you feel no pain. Maybe a stretching sensation of the skin, an explosion, yes? Because, wow, I have a baby between my legs, but it's not something you can ignore, but it's not pain. The only moments when there are pain sensations are those counted seconds... when we have contractions. Otherwise, even if the woman is in expulsion, even if the head is out, even if it's in the vagina, she only feels pressure, not pain. So, during the pause, you catch your breath, reconnect, reorganize, reinvent yourself, but you do not have unpleasant pain sensations.

And now let's talk about the Ferguson reflex. The fetus slides into the vagina, pressing on the cervix. The cervix is, yes, the opening, and the cervix being pressed by the baby, that pressure also creates dilation. When the fetus slides into the vagina, pressing the cervix, in the vagina there is... a point, which, when touched, will trigger longer and more frequent contractions. That is the moment or Ferguson point, which the baby touches so that he can be born faster and not stay too long stuck in the vagina. When the baby slides, passing from the cervix into the vagina, a greater production of oxytocin is triggered in the mother's pituitary gland, which is somewhere here, in the back. Endogenous oxytocin in the body, do you know what it favors? Contractions. Longer and more frequent contractions. And this helps the baby have an easier transition through the vaginal canal. So, the baby's head passes the cervix, slides into the vagina. These nerve impulses are transmitted to the mother, yes, to the brain. The brain stimulates the pituitary gland to secrete oxytocin. Oxytocin is transported through the bloodstream to the uterus, and the uterus begins to contract and push the baby out. This is the Ferguson reflex, which amplifies and causes contractions to become stronger and more vigorous, so that the baby's transition from the vagina into our world is shorter.

The most important thing to remember in labor is that you will feel the urge to push. During labor, during dilation contractions, you will not feel anything. You will not want to push. The idea is to push only when your body tells you to push. And you only push during a contraction. Because when we push, the baby is already in the vagina and then the mother needs to help as well. Please do not push when guided by others, because if you push when you do not have a contraction, you will tear. The vagina will tear, the cervix will tear, the perineum will tear, yes? That is why it is forbidden to do anything that your body does not consent to or feel. To consent is to feel and know that this is what your body dictates. Every time you feel the urge to push, you will do it, because the body only sends the urge to push when you have a contraction. When there is no contraction, you do not feel pain, you do not feel any sensation, and you will not feel the urge to push. So, no matter what the doctor or midwife or doula says, if you do not have a contraction, please do not do it. Please do not listen, because you should not listen to others. You should listen to your body. We push only during a contraction. Repeat after me, I push only during a contraction. Otherwise, I do not care what anyone says, who says what, how they do it, what advice they give, it does not matter. You push when you feel the urge to push, because you will feel it. Otherwise, they can say whatever they want, you do what you feel, not what you are told. Please, because then, yes, things tear, things happen, and it's not good.

You will feel the urge to push and then you will push because you only feel it during a contraction. Otherwise, we do not listen to anyone. I do not wish you harm. I want you to be well. I want you to listen to your body. I want you to trust your body, not others, because others cannot know what your body feels and what it needs.

How do the uterine muscles work during labor and birth? The uterine muscles are perfectly built to allow your baby to come out, to be pushed and to advance during labor. And now I will show you a video in which you will see exactly what these uterine muscles can do. Here you actually see how the uterus, that pink part around the baby, starts to contract. You see the contractions compressing the baby and at the same time pushing it toward the cervix, which is still closed. What you see here in white is the mucus plug. In this case, you will see how the mucus plug is lost. Why? Because there is movement at the cervix. Here the water breaks, the membranes rupture. Yes, we will discuss this. And with each contraction, you see how the baby's head pushes and dilates as well. So, this millimeter by millimeter pushing with each contraction facilitates dilation. You see how the lips of the cervix retract. This whole video is sped up because, as I said, birth is not one after another. So, there are many and long pauses between these contraction stages. Now there is complete dilation. The baby's head slides into the vagina, the fontanelles have overlapped. The baby does not advance that quickly, then will make a twist, then will be born without anyone pulling on it, just to catch it. Here the placenta detaches. This happens about thirty minutes after birth, and the baby lands on the mother's chest. And let's watch this video again to see how the uterine muscles contract and with each contraction, the baby is pressed against the cervix. The pressure on the cervix means massage. It means the cervix starts to open. From this movement, with each cervical contraction, the mucus plug will fall out. You may or may not notice it. Then the membranes may rupture. We will talk about this. When they rupture, the water and amniotic fluid leak out. Here you see how the cervix is now effaced, thinned, and begins to dilate with each new contraction. The head slides, the lips of the cervix retract like garage doors, those sliding ones, moving to the side to allow the head to slide through. In the vaginal opening, here the fontanelles overlap to reduce the circumference, so the baby's head is pointed. These hands do nothing. The baby's head does not need to be turned. The baby twists itself because otherwise it would not fit through the mother's pelvic bones. The placenta is also born about forty-five minutes after birth, and the baby lands on the mother's chest.

How do the uterine muscles work? And another picture—what does a contraction look like? What does the belly look like during a contraction? Here we actually have pictures where the woman, during labor, because of the uterine contraction, the belly changes, becomes pointed...
