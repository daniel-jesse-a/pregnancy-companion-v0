Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you at this course. Now, I will tell you a few things about myself, because it is important for you to understand why I am a prenatal educator trainer, why I chose to educate women and to tell them what they should do, how they should do it, what rights they have, what chances they have to have a beautiful and fulfilling birth. How did I come to do this? What were the most important steps in my development and healing? Because that’s what it’s about. You should know that I came to help other women precisely because I have been through it, I have been through depression, I have been through an incredibly difficult birth. I have been through moments when I didn’t think I would survive, and look, all these moments have made me who I am today. That’s how I came to do what I do. That’s how I became a therapist for pre- and perinatal trauma, meaning all the traumas related to our birth, our becoming. How do these traumas influence our lives, character, decisions, relationships? It is incredible how many things I have discovered and how many things I have learned from my own traumatic experiences. That is why I want to share with you today a bit of who I am, precisely to make you curious, to make you want to explore, in turn, everything related to your past, your experiences, your memories, even those you are not consciously aware of, but those in your subconscious, because there are many treasures there. So, let’s talk about me. Let’s talk about how I came to do what I do today. How did I become a counselor on topics such as fertility, pregnancy, birth, life with a baby, and how have I transformed, in fact, over all these years? For me, actually, it all started a very long time ago. Although I was not always a prenatal educator, I did something very different from what I do now. Twenty years ago—wow, more, twenty-five years ago—I discovered my passion and thus discovered myself. Mmm, stepping out of line, leaving the herd, leaving everything behind and doing what I love. To my parents’ surprise, especially my mother, who wanted me to become a teacher. And look, I did become a teacher, in a way. Just not a schoolteacher, as she would have wanted, but somehow a teacher in the school of life. That is, I learned on my own skin. And yes, my first passion was art, flowers, beauty. All these things that I can sum up in my first fifteen years, during which I worked as a florist, in a profession that, yes, not everyone embraced, especially since back then, right after the '90s, it wasn’t really fashionable to do such things. And yes, to my parents’ despair, I continued and followed my soul, which I recommend to everyone, because if you ever do a job that does not bring you joy, you will not find happiness and enthusiasm in any day of your life, and you will search, and your soul will clearly lead you to change this and to go towards your calling. Yes, the first part, let’s say, of my life, my calling was to show people that yes, you can dream beautifully, you can dream big. And yes, things come true when you put energy into what you love. Thus, I managed on my own, with all my own strength, without any support, to start a business, a business from the heart.

It was somehow my first floral art shop. It was a business from the heart into which I put a lot of passion, which over those fifteen years turned into about four shops, where I actually sold what mattered to me: beauty, art, decorations, I can say design, I can say books, soulful books. I also turned towards, let’s say, readings, not fiction, but readings that help you grow, to learn to know yourself. So, in a way, my search for myself, for my inner self, started back then. Only, yes, as with every person, we step onto a path we choose, which brings us exactly the experiences we need to assimilate some very important things in our lives. So I had these, let’s say, spaces where I worked, where, when you entered, you would hear beautiful music. I even sold music—film music, classical music, light music, soulful music, meditation music, books on spirituality, esoteric books, knowledge, art, furniture. So I did something totally different from what I do today, and the truth is I can say I had two totally different trajectories: one of design and beauty and... I don’t even know what to call it, art, culture, and so on. And the other part, to my surprise and everyone’s, was the part of what I do now and what defines me, because I truly feel that a great chapter in my life has ended. So, when the Art-Design chapter closed, another chapter opened—children. You should know that I was not at all the type of woman who would rush to babies and cuddle and kiss them. No, I was not crazy about children. I never was. Although I can tell you that it’s the opposite with my own children. Yes, I kiss them. I kissed them everywhere, even on their bottoms and everywhere. Yes. They have always, somehow to my surprise, gone straight to my heart. And yes, my children opened another path for me, another road. They showed me that my calling in this life can change even several times. So, from art, from design, I moved to babyhood, to birth, to womanhood, to the power of women to transform the world, to procreate, to transform from the moment of birth. And yes, children have become my second passion. And it’s not, mmm, it’s not just about my children, but about the children of this earth who come here through us and bring us extraordinary gifts. You should know that no child comes empty-handed for you or for others. They come with gifts, and they come with fantastic gifts. There are so many women who have changed not only their lives, their vision, but also their behavior, beliefs, perceptions, from the moment they became mothers. This moment of becoming a mother is a defining moment for any woman. It is like a kind of border crossing. From which you do not come out with a loss, but you come out with a gain. You come out with a gain because you might discover another side of yourself, which you didn’t even suspect, and which you can embrace and heal a lot from your past, maybe from your childhood, which was not exactly perfect. Maybe now is the time to pour out all the love you did not receive from your parents, not because they didn’t want to, but because they simply didn’t know, because they themselves, in turn, did not receive love or did not know what parental love is. So, with the children who come through you, you will always receive at least one very important gift. It would be wonderful to ask yourself what gift you have already received or are about to receive. Because, look, if you are pregnant, you are already a mother and the gift is already there. You just have to look for it, unwrap it, and enjoy it. What do I do now? I help children come into this world in a non-traumatizing, beautiful, and natural way. And I don’t just help children, but I help women and couples embrace that calling, which is not a job, it is a vocation, a calling to become a parent. Because, look, no school teaches us what we should know before becoming parents. And there are so many things that, from experience, we want to change, because we saw them in our parents, we didn’t like them, they bothered us, they made us cry when we were children, and we already decide then not to repeat the same mistakes. So yes, there are many things we want when, before this child comes, we actually remember many moments we lived when we were babies and little children. Who am I? First of all, I am a mother. I am the mother of two happy children. I think they are happy. You should know that there is no perfect relationship between mother and child. So, no matter how hard we try, our children will challenge us and push all those buttons, and later, when they become adults, they will say, look, mom made mistakes there. And we will say, well yes, but I tried my best, I gave my soul, I gave my heart, I gave my nights and my ideals and everything. And still, it’s not enough. You should know it is normal for the relationship between mother and child to be challenging on both sides. Because if it weren’t challenging, the child would not be able to feed, not physically, but emotionally, on all, um, the experiences they will need later in life as reference points. And us? We would stagnate. We would always remain the same. The fact that our children challenge us and push all those secret buttons makes us grow, makes us evolve, makes us assimilate lessons we thought were long buried, sealed, and done. Yes, so checked off. But no, it’s not like that. That’s why I say I think I have two happy children. Both were born at home, naturally. The first birth, as I mentioned at the beginning today, was a partially medicalized birth. It was a birth totally unlike what I ever wanted; after that sixty-three-hour birth in which I really thought I would die, I swore, attention, that I would never again teach prenatal courses. And here I am, breaking all my principles, all my vows, yes? And here I am, still on the front lines. Because, in fact, after that very difficult birth, in which I truly saw death with my own eyes, I fell into a depression for at least six months, in which I realized that birth is not as it is written in books. Birth, at least for me, was not like that. No, birth was not as I learned, because I had done my prenatal educator specialization before my first child, which transformed me from a mother who wanted a C-section into a mother who suddenly wanted a natural birth, and not only natural, but at home. I mean, how crazy do you have to be, right? That’s how people judged me. So yes, all these things contributed to very intense moments and very deep traumas. And because I didn’t understand for a long time why I had to go through such a terrible birth. Why me? Why did it happen to me? That’s how my healing journey actually began. Seeking to understand why it happened to me, seeking to assimilate the lessons behind the experiences. And yes, today I can say that if I hadn’t had that birth, my first birth, today I would be teaching you from books and not from personal experience. So yes, I can tell you that everything I learned was on my own skin. And my second birth, my daughter’s, was a completely medicalized birth. It lasted four and a half hours, after which I felt I had taken my revenge and I felt as if I could move mountains. Give me that mountain you want to move and I’ll move it, in which I felt so empowered that I said: “If I managed to do this, I will succeed at anything in life.” And believe me (two-second pause), many times in life, when things were hard, I forgot exactly that moment of triumph that I felt through every pore of my skin, through my whole body. That triumph and that revenge I took then with the second birth... A woman, if she does not go through a birth and does not somehow come out with these feelings of being a winner and Xena, yes, the victorious warrior, she falls into depression. Because, you see, the woman’s body was not designed to check off birth any other way. The woman’s body is capable of enjoying a beautiful and fulfilling birth, as long as we provide it with that safe environment, that perfect environment for it to unfold as such. That is why many women who inform themselves and understand what the power of natural birth really is and the power of women to give birth naturally, use this and move to another level. Because, hormonally speaking—and we will discuss this in the course you will take. Hormonally speaking, the woman’s body needs this transition experience, the transition from woman to mother, from girl to mother. Because it is, yes, a stage. It’s like in those stories with trials, which the heroes went through, yes? Harder and harder trials, because all those trials actually enriched them. How? With characteristics, with things you can only assimilate if you live them. You cannot assimilate them by paying for them. You cannot assimilate them by buying them. You can only assimilate them if you go through them and actually live them. So yes, after the second birth in which I took my revenge, I realized the value of the first birth. The value I received. The value I can pass on to you by telling you what mistakes I made, how I made them, where I made them, and what is wrong to expect from a birth when you exclude the emotional part from this very emotional and very sensitive moment. That’s what it’s about, and in fact, that’s what all the healing I went through and am still going through is about. Because, by the way, I don’t want you to see me as a miraculous healer, no! It was all hard work and it still is. Because life will always give you exactly as much as you can handle. For your level of understanding and for your level of going through a major change or a, um, change that, yes, motivates you to understand or see things from another perspective. How did it all start? Yes, I started in 2010. Um, I became a HypnoBirthing prenatal educator in Romania. I was the first HypnoBirthing prenatal educator in the country. It was a completely new method for pregnant women here, especially since HypnoBirthing at that time, um, in 2010, yes, induced a lot of fear that oh my, what will they do to us? They’ll put us to sleep, we’ll be in a state of hypnosis, they’ll wake us up after we give birth... No. It was just a method of autosuggestion through which, yes, some women can suggest many things to themselves, but that means all women have to be like a blank slate, meaning that previous experiences don’t matter, that your own birth experience doesn’t matter. That’s how I thought we functioned, and by autosuggesting myself, I, indeed, realized that, first of all, I got rid of the idea of terrifying birth, because I had only heard ugly stories about birth. My own mother told me every time that she almost died giving birth to me, and in my head I had an image that birth is dangerous, because sometimes a mother can be killed by her own child when she gives birth to him. For me, that was kind of a background. For me, it was an interface and it overlapped all my wonderful, positive affirmations that I tried to imprint. But look, these conscious imprints we make sometimes cannot cover the underlying layers and, in fact, the real memories. Because the real memories we have from our own birth. That’s why you’ll see that in this course and in all my courses you will explore your own birth. And not just yours, but also your partner’s, because both of you somehow contribute to the birth of your child. And if there are infertility problems, again, we’re not just talking about women’s infertility issues, but about the couple, about both, about what experiences both bring to this, let’s say, bringing another soul into the world. Yes, so I taught HypnoBirthing, um, after completing a one-year practice period and submitting a written thesis, because there were very precise rules at HypnoBirthing, I was certified as a prenatal educator and worked with over eight hundred couples over these years, until I realized that yes, the method is a method, but it is not applicable to everyone. That’s why, from 2010 until 2015, until March, I was a HypnoBirthing prenatal educator, after which I realized, wait a minute, it’s not just about seeing the beauty in birth, about autosuggesting yourself nicely about birth, but it’s also about working with yourself and integrating your own experiences over what you want to imprint. Because yes, it’s wonderful to believe that birth is wonderful, that it doesn’t hurt, because that’s what I preached even at HypnoBirthing, and I realized that I couldn’t apply anything at all to my own birth. Because when I expected a painless birth, because I was absolutely prepared for that, at the first contraction that hurt, my mind went blank and I said: Oh no, I’m doing something wrong. Well, from that moment everything was controlled by my mind. Everything was a whole question: why? Why does it hurt me? Why are the contractions so hard? Why are they so long? Why do they hurt when I taught women that nothing hurts and that it’s all just in our heads. No, it wasn’t in my head. And yes, it hurt. So it was a big challenge, my first birth, because I felt pain. To tell you, on a scale from zero to ten—twelve. So, I never believed in my life that I could endure so much pain. And I am not a person with a high pain tolerance, because I am super fearful. I am afraid of needles. I have a phobia of needles, of course. Childhood traumas, I have a phobia of dentists. Again, childhood traumas. So don’t torture me. Well, at birth it was something else. That’s why I said after birth, when I saw that I survived, I said never ever, I won’t talk about birth again. And here I am, with the lessons more or less learned. But yes, I no longer teach methods that promise painless births, because I realized that’s not what it’s about. Before I close the HypnoBirthing chapter, I want to recommend a book to you, but as a nice and motivating read, meaning to see that it is possible to give birth differently. Because we, unfortunately, especially in Romania, do not have enough books, such as this bestseller that I introduced in Romania with huge efforts, because no publisher wanted to publish a book that, even though it was an international bestseller, here it cost quite a lot to bring it. And yes, I even contributed money just to get that publisher to accept to publish it. And yes, it sold a few thousand copies. And yes, it is a book that at least for me, changed my thinking. From a die-hard C-section supporter, I came to want to give birth naturally, because I read such beautiful experiences. But yes, as I told you, it wasn’t like that, because the expectations were way too high and the fact that I understood then another very important thing, which is vital for you to understand as well. We cannot compare ourselves as people. We cannot compare ourselves as mothers. We cannot compare ourselves in any case, in any of the cases in which people, in fact humanity, suffers from comparison. If you look around, we always compare ourselves with a friend, a neighbor, a classmate, an older sister, a younger brother, it doesn’t matter. With someone we always compare ourselves, and all unhappiness comes from these comparisons. Here I told you, let’s say, the negative model. Now, the positive model is the same. I can’t expect that if a woman had an orgasm at birth, so be it, may it always be. I wish you to have it! I didn’t manage to have an orgasm at birth, for me birth was intense. But of course it’s possible. Of course there are women who have had orgasmic births. Of course there are women who give birth with a smile on their face. Of course there are women who have beautiful and fulfilling births. But, if your unconscious or subconscious memories from your own birth are not beautiful, because your mother did not go through a textbook birth, supported, caressed, encouraged... What are we talking about? The majority of women, ninety-five percent, talk about traumatizing births. So, if you don’t know that your mother experienced her birth in a traumatizing way, it was probably hidden from you just so you wouldn’t be burdened with it. I’m not saying it doesn’t exist. It does. I am living proof, let’s say, I am living proof that the second birth was beautiful and fulfilling. Intense, but it cannot even be compared to the first. The first lasted sixty-three hours. I thought I would die. I really thought I would die. I survived. I had a six-month depression. The second... It was intense. On a scale from zero to ten, ten being the most intense. As I told you, at the first I felt twelve in intensity, at the second I felt two or three. In the moments of maximum intensity, in contractions, even in expulsion. So, what happened? What happened is that I managed to understand some things differently from one birth to another. The difference of a year and ten months, but a difference, yes, in which, in that, in those years I truly sought to understand why it happened to me, what I did wrong, how I did wrong, and to truly explore, to remember that, in fact, I had a very poor image of my own birth. So this book is absolutely wonderful. Read it! There are other books. In the meantime, I wrote on my blog, on my website, about ten books I recommend during pregnancy. The important thing is not to set your expectations too high, because, okay, we can tell ourselves I am wonderful, I will give birth in five minutes. You can tell yourself that every day a thousand times, for nine months. But that doesn’t mean you will actually have that birth, even if you autosuggest yourself. Because autosuggestion is conscious. The problem is that our consciousness is three percent, while what governs us—our actions, character, abilities, behavior, relationships—is the subconscious, which we must explore. That’s exactly why I ended with HypnoBirthing and now have my own, let’s say, birth concept called rebirth, because, indeed, I was reborn after realizing how many things I didn’t take into account and thought that through autosuggestion I could do anything. Also during this time of, let’s say, searching and healing, I became a doula in 2012. To help you understand a bit what it means to be a doula. A doula is a companion for future mothers who want to enjoy psycho-emotional support during birth. That is, I am your friend and I come with you to the birth and I caress your head and encourage you and am by your side, and in those moments when you can’t go on, I tell you yes, you can go on, and I will massage you and touch you. And what doesn’t a doula do? Whoever hasn’t given birth with a doula is missing out, because the doula is, in fact, the woman’s pampering in those intense moments when, sensorially speaking, all your senses are activated a thousand percent, not a hundred percent. So, the doula, to make it clear again, is not a midwife. The doula does not have a medical specialization, she does not know how to resuscitate, or if she does, she knows privately, but she has done those things. But the doula does not take over the duties of a midwife. So, when we give birth, we need a midwife and at least a doula. And, of course, doctors to support or supervise the birth process. You should know that, by the way, in the past, midwives were the ones who delivered with the woman, and the doctor intervened or came only when there were complications at birth, and the birth could not proceed normally or naturally, and then women were actually helped by doctors through C-section. Lives were saved, the child’s life, the mother’s life. Unfortunately, this profession of midwife or midwife’s vocation has disappeared because, yes, the interest for money prevails again, because midwives have simply become nurses in hospitals, nurses who assist with C-sections on a conveyor belt, because that is the norm, at least in the most European countries. Ironically, there is too little natural birth and scheduled C-sections on a conveyor belt. So, midwives, until a while ago, did this alongside women and they were the foundation, and the doctor was only there to handle emergencies. So the doula will be your friend who will offer you psycho-emotional support, and the midwife will be the one who supervises with her eyes, because the midwife does not intervene. A good midwife does not intervene, but will supervise the birth process with her eyes, without touching unless necessary. And, um, that’s what actually characterizes true professionals. And a doula, if she is a true and professional doula and healed from her own birth traumas, will truly help the woman and will not burden her with her own unresolved fears, who knows from when, and from her own birth... Choose very carefully the people who will be with you when you give birth. Because, emotionally speaking, a lot is transmitted from everyone around you in those key moments. Michel Odent even said, Dr. Michel Odent, whom, if you haven’t met yet, you should look up to see what an extraordinary person he is. He also wrote a very good book, “The Caesarean,” in which you can read about natural birth, even if it has a rather tricky or catchy title. Add up, “The Caesarean” is a book that every pregnant woman should read, because not only will you learn a lot about birth, but there he tells at one point about how and how much those who assist a birth influence it. They can exclusively influence the entire birth process, can influence labor, can influence the length of labor and birth. So it is very important who is with you in those key moments. I had the opportunity to graduate from my first doula course, to better understand my own birth and to understand the psychological and emotional process of women during labor, with Andreea Luncașu and Nora Niculescu in 2012, in a course I took in Bucharest, a very intense course, in which I managed to understand much more than I thought I knew, and I had the extraordinary honor of meeting Dr. Michel Odent and Liliana Lammers, who both changed my paradigms and all my thoughts and, let’s say, those programs I thought were correct about birth. I even had the honor of having Michel Odent check my pregnancy by feeling my belly. I had two months left until I gave birth. No, one month. Yes, exactly September. Yes, I gave birth in November, so in September I had been at the course, right at the end, so I had a month and a few days left until I gave birth. And he told me then that yes, look, your baby has turned and everything will be fine, because I hadn’t gone for a checkup with my second pregnancy and I was very curious if the baby had turned or not. In the meantime, I found out that you can feel and read the baby’s signals so you can tell if the baby is turned or not. If you follow my courses, you will understand all these things and I will teach you how it’s done, because it’s very simple. You don’t need someone to do this for you. You can feel it yourself as a mother or as a couple. You, as a couple, can know exactly what is happening. In 2010, I founded the “Mothers for Mothers” association and managed to implement the birth plan, the Birth Plan, an actual course you must take to know what your rights are at birth and what your child’s rights are at birth. In 2010, we managed to implement it in several maternity hospitals. The first maternity hospital was in Brașov, where I also collaborated for several years with the doctors there, because we implemented a baby-friendly hospital program, accredited by IMBCI. IMBCI stands for International Mother Baby Child Initiative, a program I introduced in Romania with the help of a renowned midwife from the United States, who also came and was present at the opening when we implemented this project in Brașov. Together with an exceptional doctor, Dr. Ionel Aurel, we started this gentle birth project at Egva Maternity, where we also set up a special birth room for all women who wanted something different at birth. And that’s how I actually started a collaboration that lasted several years. Maybe too few, because I would have liked it to last much longer. But unfortunately, the system is too tight to allow women to give themselves permission to give birth in a hospital setting as would actually be beautiful and correct. Yes, because yes, small hospitals are usually taken over by the big fish. You know what I’m talking about. So this project, after three years from its founding, had to end. And yes, unfortunately, all we got out of it was the experience and the idea that it is possible. And then we managed to implement the birth plan, which has remained. Even if they buried the project, the idea of the magic hour remained. Even if the project was buried, the idea of not separating the child from the mother and breastfeeding in the first 30 minutes after birth remained. Again, things that still could not be destroyed, because they are correct and because they must happen and because they are normal and natural, and because without them there is trauma. So yes, even if some projects were destroyed, others survived, others were done later, you should know that all these things remained because women are becoming more and more aware and because they demand their rights. Not because I have been shouting about this for so many years, but because every woman, when she goes to give birth, knows her rights, knows about birth, knows what to expect, what to expect from her own body, knows what to do, and this is the power. When you know what your job is, when you know what you can do, when you know what you can ask for, then you will receive, because you will ask. Because if you don’t ask, absolutely nothing happens and you will enter that, let’s say, conveyor belt where everything happens upside down. The seminars with Jack Newman from Canada. I don’t know if you’ve heard of Jack Newman, but if you become a mother, you will need Dr. Jack Newman’s breastfeeding guide, who is the father of all breastfeeding mothers. In March 2014, I had the opportunity to meet him in person and attend the breastfeeding seminars. And yes, it helped me a lot. And yes, I am not a lactation consultant, but for the first steps you can take after birth and in the first months, what you will learn from the course you will complete is absolutely sufficient. What else did I learn? Very important, from those who founded the Micro Birth School, is that the microbiome is especially important in breastfeeding. And I will tell you about this microbiome when we talk about birth practices that favor colonization with bacteria at the time of the first breastfeeding. That is why colostrum is very important. The magic hour is very important. It is vital to start off right and not randomly, because many women are not encouraged to breastfeed. Their baby is taken away, and they lose the start, and not them, but their babies lose the start for a healthy digestive tract, a natural health of the digestive tract. And that means breastfeeding, not bottle feeding. I have also specialized, among other things, in hypnosis and NLP or neuro-linguistic programming, because I realized I needed to understand what happened at my own birth and I realized I needed all this information to heal from that trauma, from that first birth experience. And through this healing and understanding of why it happened to me, I managed to help mothers give birth without fear, with complete confidence in their wonderful bodies. So, everything I did for myself, to heal from the trauma of my first birth, helped me enormously to show other women that it is possible and that it is natural to want to heal. And life will always guide you exactly in the direction you need and in that direction that will help you heal the traumatic experience. Here and on my website dittadepner.ro you will find all the diplomas I have obtained over all these years. One of the diplomas I am very proud of is the diploma received from Frank Pucelik, one of the founders of NLP. This diploma was hard to get, because half of the group I had, the group I had at the course, which lasted three weeks, did not receive diplomas, so I felt honored to receive this diploma as, let’s say, a trainer. I learned an enormous amount from this man and he structured my mind and everything very nicely. And by the way, those of you who want to prepare for life, for interaction with other people, for relationships not only close but also distant, I recommend you take NLP courses, because you will learn to know yourself and to know others, because, in fact, that’s what we need to have harmonious relationships with those around us. In 2014, I also completed a course that taught me an enormous amount. It is also related to the practice of autosuggestion, of hypnosis. It is called Sleep Talk. It was, in fact, a method developed by John Golding from Australia. She founded Sleep Talk therapy for children, which made me understand even more that children, if they had traumatic births—and I told you I had this traumatic birth with my first child, and I can tell you from experience that he is very different from his younger sister, precisely because it is defining, it is defining how a child is born. And I realized how much healing a child who came through a difficult birth needs. And somehow this course helped me realize that not only does the woman need to heal after a traumatic birth, to function and to be a, let’s say, at least okay mother, yes, because when...

When you are in depression, nothing works anymore, and there is also a need for the healing of the child. But it is always necessary for the mother to take the first step. She always needs to heal first, because otherwise, she cannot support the healing of her child. So, in my courses and in my healing gatherings, I offer exactly this kind of support. In a very complex six-week program, I teach women how to integrate the experience of a traumatic birth, to heal themselves and to heal their child as well. Specifically, to heal the birth experience, which is so defining for so many aspects of our lives, from character, to abilities, to relationships, to confidence, and much more. So, I have learned enormously from there as well.

Here, I can proudly show this picture as proof that I walked on hot coals for almost ten meters. In April 2016, at Tony Robbins’ course in England—I recommend it. The man is brilliant and it is an experience that changes you forever. Especially now that Tony Robbins holds all these courses online with thousands and millions of people. I took this course in a stadium with about five hundred people and it was a wow course. Anyway, Tony Robbins seems to me to be the person who can change your state in five minutes, in a five-minute video. This man can pull you out of depression. It’s incredible. So, he too has come with a super mission. So yes, I recommend you follow him because he has so much to offer.

I attended Unleash the Power Within in April 2016. That’s exactly how we all were, and it was an extraordinary experience. I am grateful that I realized all these valuable people somehow became trainers and examples because life taught them—taught them harshly, but also beautifully and very hard at the same time. But precisely because this hardship shaped them and made them into diamonds that shine. I love Tony Robbins and he is an extraordinary person. Watch a few videos and see for yourself that he is truly someone you can learn from.

What I admired most about Tony Robbins was that he told us that during those days—the course was Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday—one of the days, he wasn’t there. So, out of four days, three days he was there and one day it was someone else, but that person was also extraordinary. He didn’t eat, he fasted with only water, and the energy was wow! It was through the roof. That man could easily support tens of thousands of people, even if he didn’t have direct interaction with all of us who were there. But he touched us... He touched us deeply.

Another training that changed me and gave me a new perspective was with Elena Tonetti Vladimirova in Germany in 2019, a sixteen-day course. It was a fantastic experience. During those days, I learned about the limbic imprint at birth and about pre- and perinatal trauma therapy. I suspected many things from there, but I didn’t believe that this limbic imprint was so deeply rooted in our bodies. And somehow, after this course, I realized that our body forgets nothing. It remembers everything, even if not at a conscious level. So yes, it was a unique opportunity to meet other people and to meet her, this woman who has truly changed the birth experience of our times.

In my live courses with me, you will be able to watch the films made and recorded by this wonderful woman, who has truly changed the entire perspective on birth. She brought birth to another level, to that level of higher understanding that how you were born matters in order to understand how you will give birth to your own child. So, the work this woman has done is fantastic and she has a special merit in the world of childbirth and in changing the world of birth.

I also had a very important training with Carol Dawson in England in 2019, on EFT and Matrix Reimprinting, where I continued to deepen the fact that all these things are imprinted, but they can also be removed from this imprint. So, that limbic reimprint can be done. There were two parts of this training that made me understand that EFT, or Emotional Freedom Technique, is a very effective technique for removing traumas and, in my courses, I usually explain that it is a very easy method, applicable not only to us adults, but also to children. You only need to take a few steps that are very simple to do. It’s a very light tapping. Some key points that I will give you and explain to you.

So, I have learned many things from remarkable people, and they have helped me a lot in my work with myself, in healing my own traumas, and in working with my clients. Here you can also see the EFT and Matrix Reimprinting therapist diploma from this course. So, it wasn’t just a graduation course, but also a diploma I obtained after writing a paper.

What I liked most was that after this EFT and Matrix Reimprinting course, I was able to graduate from the Birth Reimprinting course with Sharon King, whom I love and who is an extraordinary woman, and whose book I recommend—oh, I have a lapse—Heal Your Birth, Heal Your Life. So, her book is called Heal Your Birth, Heal Your Life, and it is a book you must read, especially since it comes with a lot of information that you will also hear from me and which I was happy to reread there. Even though I have been teaching these things for a long time, I was glad to see them in other books as well. It’s like a confirmation that what I know and what I do is okay.

So, it is important to know whether you were born or how you were born. How did your mother experience it, so that you can later understand a possible experience with your own child? So, a course I recommend now. Yes, probably everything happens online now, but it is a course that changed my life.

Of course, I couldn’t stop, and also in 2019, I met Brigitte Mesmer, a warm-hearted, wonderful midwife who works in Switzerland and who held a course on healing pre- and perinatal trauma for babies. This helped me realize again how much women need healing, so that afterwards they can heal their child’s birth, because the birth of the child imprints their character, their reactions, their trust in the world, in the mother, in everything. The course with her was extraordinarily beautiful, and I also have an interview with her on YouTube. She has written many books, and the method she presents is partly included in my own method for healing a traumatic birth, applicable to babies. So, this woman is gold. If someone is lucky enough to give birth with her in Switzerland, she is very fortunate.

I continued to explore my own traumas with a method recommended by Dr. Bruce Lipton. Surely you have heard of Bruce Lipton? If you haven’t, I recommend The Biology of Belief, one of Bruce Lipton’s cornerstone books. I graduated with Brunhilde Hoffmann in Switzerland, in 2019, from the Psych-K course, which again gave me tools for healing traumas by understanding how the brain works and how all these imprints are located in one of the hemispheres and how they can be dissolved and healed. So yes, at one point I was not a workaholic, but a course-aholic, if I can put it that way. And I realized that all these courses gave me even more knowledge and more options to choose exactly what I feel works best. And all these courses I graduated from have helped me enormously in developing my own—let’s say, not a method, because it’s not a method, since a method is something you can apply to everyone. No, it’s, let’s say, a concept that you can apply differently to each case, to each person. Because yes, we are not the same, and we cannot be treated the same, and we do not have recipes. At least, I don’t.

Here are a few pictures with Brunhilde Hofmann and with the method implicitly recommended by Bruce Lipton himself. It was a super experience, after which there was another experience before 2020, when the lockdown started and we could no longer attend live courses—in Thailand, in Chiang Mai, on Tao and Tantra with Master Mantak Chia. Mantak Chia is wow! From my point of view, he gave me the next level of understanding of how our body works and how beautifully we can, through breathing, through awareness, dissolve even, let’s say, incipient conditions or illnesses, if we do things long-term. And he made me understand how much it matters. The psyche and the emotional side, and how much a negative psyche makes us sick, and how much our emotions influence our health.

So, from this point of view, I learned a lot about fertility, about sexual energy, about how a couple should be in order to procreate. Because we think too little about this energetic side; many people think, “That’s it, I got married, now we have a house, food, a job, a career, and now we procreate.” But we don’t actually think about whether we are energetically able to procreate, because energy matters. If the woman is exhausted, if the man is unmotivated, if they are worn out by a job that doesn’t fulfill them, by a dull life, if they don’t have a proper lifestyle, all these things influence fertility. And then, of course, we need to prepare ourselves. And sexual energy in conception is what gives life. If we don’t have sexual energy, the child cannot be formed, because it needs the energy of both parents. So, the more depleted the partners are, the more fertility goes down the drain.

So, I learned many very important things about fertility from Mantak Chia and Charles Muir. And it was an extraordinarily complex course, especially on this esoteric side. And so yes, I can say that I have accumulated a lot of experience, and not only that, but also my therapeutic experience with my trainers, with whom I work month after month and from whom I learn how complex the human being is and how many conflicts we can generate from our conflicting thoughts, from our lifestyle, from the relationships we have, from human interactions... I learn every day, and this learning never stops.

So yes, I will be able to share with you everything I have accumulated, especially regarding fertility, pregnancy, birth, and life with a baby. Because I have lived these things, because I have gone through different experiences that have marked me, have broken me down, have lifted me up at the same time, have enriched me, and have completed me so beautifully. So, I thank you for following me so far. Thank you for being interested in your own rebirth, and thank you for following my activity and all my projects, and I am glad you have decided to take a step towards yourself. See you at the course! Thank you.
