Hello, my dear! I am glad to see you for a special lesson, because in this lesson I want to talk to you about how a soul comes into the world. It is not just about birth or conception, or about how we bring a soul into this world, but it is about much more. That is why today I will talk to you about the journey of the soul, about the plan each soul has in this life, about the idea of becoming pregnant, and the mistaken belief that it is only about the two of us—my partner and I—who must conceive a child. We will talk about the agreement of the three souls, which must be unanimous for conception to occur. We will talk about the creative energy necessary to create a new form of life. I will also tell you about the mission with which each soul comes, because we do not come here for nothing, but we come with a destiny that leads us toward the personal mission we set for ourselves long before we were born. I will tell you about ways to discover this destiny, because there are quite a few ways to find or discover your path or destiny in life. I will also tell you how a soul chooses its parents. We will talk about the mother's womb, about the nine months of initiation into this world that each soul goes through. We will discuss the most important relationship we have when we come here, and we will also talk a bit about numerology and the idea of how we come and what numbers are significant when we come into this world.

So let us begin with a chapter that is very little known to many people, because yes, these aspects are not talked about, simply because I believe there is a reason why people do not talk about the soul or the soul's plan, precisely to create even more mystery and even more fear of this, let's say, unseen, unknown, unexplored plan, but with much evidence and many authors who write about it. Precisely to create that taboo, so that people are not interested in informing themselves or searching unless they are strongly confronted with this subject: death, life, birth, and so on.

Do you know how a soul comes to earth? I believe it is not just a theory, but it is actually what I have managed to read from many authors, authors who, as they say, wrote independently, not together. And my intuition tells me that, indeed, things make sense when we do not refer to a person as just a kind of shell in which we spend a life, after which we die and have no purpose or business. The idea is that, long before we are born, we make plans, we make plans related to this earthly existence that we propose for ourselves and the purpose of this experience, because no one comes for nothing. No one comes without a very precise purpose. No one comes without a mission, no matter how big or small, or significant or less significant that mission may be. I have always liked this quote that no one lives only for themselves. It is clear that we come with a mission, and what is beautiful in all this weaving is that our missions intertwine so harmoniously that we help each other in our evolution.

Because that is what existence is about. We come to evolve, we come to learn, we come to assimilate abilities, qualities. We come to experience something different from what we have experienced in other lives. So the soul does not just fall from the sky. (laughs) The soul chooses its path in this life very carefully and with many details. And not only does it choose its path, but it also chooses its challenges. It chooses its experiences, because with these experiences, it knows it will be able to strengthen, I know, certain traits, certain abilities, and assimilate them. Because that is what it is about. We do not come here to take something physical with us, but we take with us experience, abilities, aptitudes. (flashlight noise) We take with us knowledge, we take with us things that do not necessarily have a physical form, but are spiritual.

And now, (blows) many women, because I also deal with this aspect of fertility or infertility, which more and more people are facing, people still have the impression that when they decide to bring another soul into this existence, it is only about the two of them. Fortunately, (laughs) it is not just that, and the agreement of the three souls involved is always needed. Many books have been written. I can definitely recommend a few of them. A book that opened the door to this subject for me was "Memories of Heaven" by Wayne Dyer, which is a compilation of real stories, not fiction, collected from families who have children that still remember fragments from the world we all come from. "The Other World" is an absolutely wonderful book, in which those souls who are still in the form (laughs) of a child still have access to that knowledge and tell how they chose their parents.

This is not just, let's say, a rare thing, but it is very frequent, and I have even encountered it among my students, over these decades I have worked in this field, who have told me how their five- or six-year-old child recounted how they chose their parents. One of the stories that somehow stuck with me is the story of a former student of mine, who said that her little boy, around six years old, had a very interesting conversation with her one evening and said: "Mom, do you know when I chose you?" And she, well, did not realize it was a great revelation, she simply thought he expressed himself wrong or made some random statement. And she said, "No. When did you choose me?" And he said: "I chose you when I saw you on the motorcycle with dad, super happy, and I said yes, you will be my mom." And she was speechless because she could not believe it. Indeed, it was long before his conception, a moment when they had just met, and he took her for a ride on the motorcycle, and she was super in love and super happy, and they had some extraordinarily beautiful moments, and there was no way anyone could have told the child about those moments, because no one knew about those sensations and feelings and moments she had lived then with the child's father.

So, another very beautiful story is one I read in Wayne Dyer's book and which has stayed with me for many years and which I always tell in my courses. Similarly, a little girl, one evening before bed, tells her mother: "You know that when I first came, I went to Aunt Sara?" And the woman says: "What do you mean, the first time you came, how? Tell me, I don't understand what you mean." She says: "Well, the first time I went to Aunt Sara." Sara being her mother's sister. "But something happened there. When I saw you, I said no-no-no, you have to be my mom." And she said: "Well, how nice, but what a thing! Okay, let's go to sleep." And after she put the girl to bed, she called her sister, Sara. And she says: "Were you pregnant about seven or eight years ago?" And of course, her sister Sara burst into tears. And she says: "Yes, but how do you know? Because I haven't told anyone." Indeed, the little girl had apparently been with her sister, Sara. And yes, she changed her mind and came to her, because she said you were very beautiful. So these are not just theories, but there are many books written on this topic. One of the books I recommend is written by Ian Van Helsing, "Children of the Third Millennium." Another extraordinary book about how these souls choose us as parents and what criteria they have. Because this is also very important. The souls that choose us to accompany them as parents in this life choose us for several reasons, not for the palaces or bank accounts we have or lack. Not for that, but for the experiences they need to fulfill their mission. When you understand these things, it will be much easier for you to... feel better in your own skin and more confident that you are the perfect parents for this child who chose you, because they could have chosen from 7 billion. Any situation, anything, any option. Because there are so many options that even when a soul chooses us, we are chosen very carefully. And it matters not whether we know how to cook, don't know how to cook, don't like ironing, have a house, I don't know what kind, have an apartment, don't have a place to stay, live, I know, in a trailer or... It doesn't matter. The experience matters because material goods do not matter in all this, but what experience will be useful to the soul that will choose you as parents. In the destiny and mission they have chosen, that is.

Yes, regarding conception. Conception happens if there is enough creative energy, and I have studied this a lot from Mantak Chia, and there are certain requirements for a fusion to be successful. Because yes, there are many amorous unions in which nothing actually happens. Even though the woman is ovulating, the man does his part, but things do not happen. I know thousands of couples who are, not personally, but from what is written to me, in which they are actually fertile. With all the paperwork in order, meaning tests and all the searching. And they are told yes, you can have children, but they do not succeed, even though the conditions are favorable. This is the moment when we start to ask ourselves questions. Why? Why doesn't it work? Why doesn't it function? Why do embryos stop developing? Why do spontaneous miscarriages happen earlier or later in pregnancy? Why do some souls change their minds? Why do some souls stay? Why do some souls choose a long life, others a medium life, others a short life, others do not even make it past the pregnancy period? All these things are many reasons that accumulate and contribute exactly to the experience the soul wants. And the parents who go through such things clearly also chose, in their destiny, before coming, such an experience, to learn and assimilate certain things.

So, what is the deal with creative energy? It's very simple. Energy helps us to exist, to have enough energy to wake up in the morning, to exist, to work, to find our mission, to live, to enjoy. And when there are, of course, challenges in each person's life, this energy can decrease or suffer at some point, because we are not always well. We get sad, upset, have moments of pessimism, or we are well, exuberant, and then the energy is good. Now, our organs also need energy. And it has been established that there are very important organs that need a certain amount of energy to function. Now, I couldn't believe it when I learned that our kidneys need about twenty-five percent of our body's vital energy. So, twenty-five percent of our daily energy goes every moment to the kidneys. Usually, when you are upset, sad, tired, exhausted, the kidneys are the first to suffer—the adrenals. We know the story, or if you don't, you find out now. The next organs that need a lot of energy, also twenty-five percent, are our sexual organs. If, for example, we have a chaotic love life, in which the man, let's say, loses his energy in many orgasms with ejaculation, then clearly his energy will decrease, and the energy of the sperm that must reproduce and find the egg to fertilize it will not be enough for a fusion with the conception of another soul.

So. The idea is as follows. When the kidneys, which are the first affected by feelings of exhaustion, sadness, and other things, when they are deprived of that twenty-five percent energy, they start to steal, just like the saying goes, "steal electricity," right? They start to steal energy from the sexual organs. So exhaustion, sadness, and a chaotic life can lead to depletion of the sexual organs, which means that the kidneys, after they need to function, will steal energy from the sexual organs, and from that moment the person can no longer reproduce because there is not enough energy in their sexual organs. Neither the woman nor the man has energy anymore. So twenty-five percent in both, whether you are a woman or a man, must exist in the sexual organs. The funny thing is that the rest of the organs in our body need, let's say, the remaining fifty percent. So they share the energy very nicely. Yes, but the kidneys and sexual organs are the most demanding. So it is no wonder that when we do not have enough creative energy, because the kidneys steal energy, the fusion will not take place. Even if all the conditions exist. There is ovulation, there is sperm, everything is in place. But if these primordial energetic conditions do not exist, the embryo will stop developing because it will not have enough fuel to function. This is what happens with most spontaneous miscarriages. Of course, conventional medicine will have no explanation, but energetically speaking, we are not just machines that run on oxygen or whatever we think, but we are simply a combination of physical, mental, emotional, and energetic. This is very important, because many of us do not realize why certain things do not work. And yes, usually, when something no longer works, the body gives signs. And yes, fertility leaves much to be desired when we weaken our energy and spend it on things that are not so important. Yes, pay great attention to your energy and how you keep it and how you multiply it, yes? Because we need energy to exist and to enjoy life.

So, returning to the idea of the soul, just as you chose to come with a mission at an important moment, because look, we chose when to be born. In the same way, another soul chooses to come here with a mission at a precise, beneficial, and necessary moment. I suppose if you have followed me, you know very well that not the mother, not the doctor, not someone from outside breaks the egg for the chick to come out. The exact same thing happens with humans. The child initiates birth, and this is known. It is known that about forty-eight hours before birth, the baby in the womb stops certain functions, not vital ones, of course, such as the imitation of breathing—it stops that inhale-exhale movement of the diaphragm, even though it does not breathe in the womb, because its lungs are not yet functional, and its lungs are still filled with a liquid similar to gastric fluid. The baby will have this inhale-exhale movement throughout the pregnancy. Forty-eight hours before birth, it will stop this, let's say, imitation of breathing, which it will do all its life until its last breath. And thus, it initiates birth. Very interesting, yes, how the child knows when it will be born because everything is predefined, we preset many things, meaning we preset our mission, trials, challenges, and options for all the possibilities you, as a human being, could make having free will. Free will refers exactly to those options you are free to choose in your life. So free will exists, but it exists within a limit in which you pursue your mission, and then you choose your challenges, people, circumstances, experiences according to what you set out to assimilate.

That is why it is almost impossible not to follow your mission in life unless you are fantastically stubborn and do everything the other way around. Because all the premises in our life already lead us toward the mission we have chosen and the experiences we have chosen. Yes, all the experiences we live in this life are chosen by us with the idea of developing, assimilating, learning new abilities, qualities, traits, characteristics, things that the soul assimilates from existence to existence and carries forward as deep knowledge. That is why there are, and I follow, many people who bring their talent even from another life. Recently, I watched, by accident, of course, some clips with babies. A one-year-old baby playing the piano. With his fingers, the notes of a song he had never heard. And believe me, I played the piano for years. To read notes or know chords or have a musical ear, you clearly have to learn if you have no knowledge in this field. So, people who clearly brought these talents from another existence, and there are millions of examples. This is just one that came to mind to tell you. But each soul chooses a precise mission in this life, which is why it chooses a precise moment. We are not born, even if the mother scheduled a C-section, it will not be exactly the moment it should be, because otherwise, we would not have chosen this mother. So, regardless of how we are born, our mission is, let's say, protected by everything that is to happen, because that is why we come.

For example, to find out more about the mission of your future child, you will note the exact time of birth. Why? Because with this exact time, you can find a natal astrological chart with many details about the qualities and abilities with which this soul comes into this world. This helps you as a parent, so as not to show your child, let's say, or force them with all sorts of ideas we have, that no, you can't become a hairdresser, you have to become a doctor or whatever, but you know how much pressure there was from our parents to do things we may not have wanted to do or certain schools or universities. Anyway, even here there is not much mistake. But as an idea, the soul comes with a baggage that it will use from existence to existence, again, toward its mission, toward fulfilling its mission.

Today there are many ways to find out about yourself or your child. From different techniques, to divination, to whatever you want—astrology, numerology, name reading, Human Design. There are so many options that we are actually the most privileged in these years, because so many options have appeared that you really have a choice, and all will tell you about the same things. Very interesting. So, to better understand the purpose for which we all came into this existence, you can use these arts of divination, astrology, human design, numerology, name reading, all sorts of things. Or you can heal your traumas to access your calling and understand what is happening to you and integrate your experiences and know how to read your body, because, look, the body will be your best friend. And if you know how to interpret the signals your body sends you, you will clearly have every chance to choose the path you actually preset for yourself.

So, my dear, your child chose you to be their mother and your partner to be their father. Because, look, regardless of how your relationship is, you two are the perfect parents for what they set out to experience in this existence. Yes, you heard right. You are the perfect parents, even if you may be a happy couple, maybe you will not get along, maybe at some point something will happen and you will not be together or you are already separated. Maybe this child came from a big mistake with the wrong partner. It doesn't matter. The child knows what they are choosing. The child knew beforehand that they needed exactly these circumstances to access their calling. So it doesn't matter. The preconceived ideas we have about how a family should function, how it should be. We actually learn about family from our own parents. And to be honest, I only saw love in them all their lives. My mother, for example, stayed married to be good for the children, even though it was not good for us, because the atmosphere was horrible, and she divorced only when we were fourteen. I was fourteen and my brother was younger. And I realized that my father had always been an absent father. But all these things, regardless of how they were, led to what I am today, someone who lived with an absent father and became both man and woman. That is, I, in order to fulfill my mission, which is sometimes not at all easy, this is exactly how I can make it. I realize that if things had been a little different, I would have been very different. And somehow this is the beauty, that when you understand the why, why you chose those parents, why you chose the experiences you had, why some people behaved a certain way so you could learn your lessons, it is fascinating. So this journey into the universe of why, not just to calm your mind, but to be able to integrate what happened to you, is an absolutely fascinating journey.

So, what can you do as a mother? First of all, create a welcoming womb for your baby. That means being well with yourself. Be confident, and the baby will feel this confidence as being in the safest place on earth. My dear, we all have challenges, master yours, know yourself, uncover all your X-files that you have and do not know, because it will help you enormously in deep self-knowledge. Because that is where the work with yourself and your perfection begins, because that is what you set out to do. You did not come here just to eat, sleep, and have a child. You came here to heal, to assimilate lessons, to assimilate qualities, abilities, and so on. Pregnancy can be one of the greatest launching pads for you as a woman, for you as a woman in a couple, for your relationship, for finding your personal mission. So, pregnancy is an extraordinary opportunity for self-knowledge for any woman, and not just for women, but also for men. Even though now I am mainly talking to you, dear woman, know that the same thing happens for any human being, whether woman or man.

And now let's see why the relationship with the mother is, let's say, the most important relationship in our lives. And somehow the relationship with the mother is the most important relationship to heal. Because from there we understood how the world works. The mother is our first encounter with this world. We spend nine months in her womb, nine months in which we do not just stay, but learn, integrate, assimilate a way of relating to the world. That is why the mother is our first encounter and at the same time the primary relationship in this world. And the relationship with the mother will be the reference model for all other relationships. Why? In the mother's womb, we learn how the world we are coming into works. Depending on the mother's experiences during pregnancy, we already form in the limbic brain a way of relating to what is outside the mother, to the world. So, depending on how you live your pregnancy, you shape your child's way of relating to the outside world. If you have a beautiful pregnancy, with confidence, with exuberance, with everything as it should be, your child will learn that this world is welcoming, trustworthy, safe, and will not have, let's say, fears or believe that this world is hostile or adverse. So, you can do a lot already during pregnancy to give your child that healthy and correct start, because, you see, it depends a lot on you how you live your pregnancy or how you have lived it.

Now, regardless, I want to tell you, no matter what happens or is happening, know that the child assumes and has assumed the fact that you did not know these things until now and the fact that now you know them and will use them to your and their advantage. And the fact that, look, you now have this immense chance to change things in your life. They have assumed all these things, so nothing is new, nothing is bad, everything is exactly as it should be. But the sooner you start working on yourself, the better, because it is for your good and theirs. Things can be learned and transmitted in other ways. It is not necessarily necessary to go through traumas to assimilate certain things.

And now a bit of numerology, which I found very interesting. The gestation period lasts about two hundred eighty days, which is divisible by seven, that is, about forty weeks and related to seven. The journey of the newly fertilized egg to the uterus, where it will attach to the uterine wall in the endometrium, lasts seven days. Then we have twenty-one days, which is again divisible by seven, which is the fastest and most important period of embryo development, then we have sixty-three days, that is, nine times seven, for the perfection of the organs and all the components of the body. Then we have ninety-one days, that is, thirteen weeks times seven, in which the human being is completely formed. Ninety-one days means the first three months. In the first three months, the human being is completely formed. You will see a little person. The next twenty-seven weeks are one hundred eighty-nine days, representing the period of maturation, perfection, and preparation for life after birth. See how we have the repetition of seven, as in the stories with Prince Charming. And regarding our evolution from conception to departure, we also deal with the number seven. The embryo is called an embryo from seven to forty-nine days. The fetus is called a fetus from forty-nine days, that is, seven times seven, until birth. Childhood lasts seven years. From seven to fourteen years is puberty. From fourteen to twenty-one years is adolescence. From twenty-one to twenty-eight years, we have the young adult. From twenty-eight to thirty-five, we have the period of relationships and family, when we are concerned with this subject. From thirty-five to forty-two years, we have the career, and from forty-two to forty-nine, we have the period of social contribution. After which, supposedly, we start over with childhood, so from the beginning, but when we start over, with another life experience, it will be a bit different.

So let's start this pregnancy on the right foot and do as much as we can to make our lives easier and to find our mission and to help this child come exactly as they should. Thank you, and see you at the next lesson.
