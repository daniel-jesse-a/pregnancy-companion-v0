(boscheta) (sound of busy phone) Hello, my dear, and I am glad to see you again at this course where you will learn what and how to do, especially during the most intense moments of your labor. I will now tell you about the structure of this breathing course, which includes some techniques specially developed by me for labor and delivery. Believe me, these will be the most important moments of your child’s birth and will have a fantastic emotional impact on you both. So, please, let’s go through this together and allow me to show you the benefits you will gain if you practice these breathing techniques that you will learn with me.

I will now briefly tell you what you will learn in the dilation breathing course, because you will learn two breathing techniques. The first technique, which I will now describe in detail, is the breathing technique during dilation contractions, because these prepare the way for your baby to be born. And there is a second breathing technique that you will learn with me in this recorded course, which will be the special breathing technique for the pushing phase. Usually, at that time, women decompensate and, in fact, don’t know anything anymore. They forget everything, everything they have heard or learned, and wait for instructions from the medical staff. This is exactly the problem, and that’s why I will show you in this short video why it is so important not only to go through the technique itself, but to practice it. Because by practicing it, it will somehow become second nature to you, and you will do it without needing to think, because it will become a repetition that will—will become your second nature. That is exactly what you need to do to manifest it automatically, without having to think: “What did Adita say in the dilation and pushing breathing course?”

So, in the first course about breathing during cervical dilation, I will teach you how to breathe during dilation contractions, precisely to alleviate those discomfort sensations you will have. Because I must tell you, and I really want you to know, that birth is not a kind of fun or something that passes quickly and is forgotten, because it’s not like that. Birth is very intense and, depending on how prepared you are, you will be able to manage this intense period of labor more easily or with more difficulty. In this course, where you will learn how to breathe exactly during these dilation contractions, you will see that you will succeed in alleviating the sensations of pain, and the first, this breathing technique I have developed is called “gentle breathing with a pink puff on the lips.” I gave it a funny name, let’s say, because it will be a visualization that I will explain to you in the course and that we will exemplify and that you will understand, because I will show you step by step what you need to do, how you need to do it, and especially, how many times you need to practice this technique, precisely to master it, especially in those intense moments of labor.

This special technique created by me, which I have titled “gentle breathing with a pink puff on the lips,” is a technique that must become routine for you. You will need to do it automatically, without thinking. And believe me, I promise it will not take you more than two minutes a day. If you want, it can take four minutes. Four minutes a day, from today until your baby is born, I don’t think is a big effort, because you can fit it anywhere in your daily schedule. And believe me, those four minutes you now invest to have a beautiful and easy birth will be worth every dollar, so to speak, because at the time of birth, whatever the birth curve, even if it only lasts two years, it will prove that this investment of four minutes daily will be gold. Because for something to become a reflex, you have to repeat it so many times until you do it automatically, without thinking. This is exactly the secret I will reveal to you in the course we are about to do and go through together.

And now I want to talk to you about the second breathing technique. It is the breathing technique for the pushing phase, which is more intense than, let’s say, the cervical dilation period, which is not as intense as the actual pushing of the baby. What does pushing mean? Because many women confuse this last part of labor with parts from the middle. So, pushing means from the moment the baby’s head enters the vagina and slides gently towards the exit. Precisely because these moments are very important, and depending on how you manage them, the birth will either be prolonged or will advance, it depends on you, only on you and how you manage this period. And this is exactly what I want to teach you, because in all my courses, over these fourteen, thirteen years of experience, I have noticed that most women do not practice this technique and I found out afterwards that at birth, towards the end, that is, during pushing, they panicked, asked for a cesarean, didn’t know how to breathe anymore, it was total chaos. Very few, and these were only those who had practiced the technique. And it’s not that I have anything to gain by asking you to practice, but you have everything to gain when you listen to my advice, because it is advice that will help you. It is exactly what you need to do and it has proven to be correct. So the technique is very good. All the women who practiced it managed to give birth easily and quickly, because they did not block labor, did not block pushing, they breathed correctly.

And here, this course about breathing during pushing will be a bit longer, I know, but believe me, in all these years in which I have held live or online courses, live with my students, the course you will see today or tomorrow, when you start it, is, let’s say, the cream of all the experiences I have accumulated and all the feedback I have received from these experiences with other women who attended the course and practiced. And yes, those who did this technique and practiced it during pregnancy managed to give birth easily and beautifully, which I wish for you as well.

So, I will now briefly present what we will cover in this pushing breathing course, which, as I told you, is longer, precisely so you understand that your mind needs to grasp all the mechanisms and I will explain to you in great detail, not only physiologically what happens, but also emotionally and physically, because the emotional influences the physical. I will now explain to you, with a few images, about breathing during pushing and the technique I have specially developed for those intense pushing contractions, and I have generically called it “vocalization during pushing.” And you will understand, after going through the course, why I called it vocalization during pushing and not something else, because indeed, it is, let’s say, a technique of vocal or sound breathing. And you will realize, after you go through this course, why this vocalization or sound-making during your birth is so important.

What I can tell you is that over the years and centuries, the pushing of the baby has indeed become every woman’s nightmare. And, of course, this is the number one reason for elective cesarean. Because, look, this is the image presented to us. This is what birth looks like on television and in the media. This is what we see when someone shows us how birth happens. If I show you this image, you will know exactly that it is from a movie or a recording of a birth. Because all the images in our heads are literally horror images with women giving birth screaming, suffering, in total agony, in excruciating pain. And this is what we understand birth to be.

So, I must tell you that no, birth does not have to look like this, and this special technique with which women, let’s say, have become terrified and only want to give birth by cesarean so as not to go through that moment of pushing the baby through the vagina... It is called in a certain way. It is called Valsalva and, ironically, it has been taught for decades, starting with the first, let’s say, mother’s preparation or school courses, which were done, I know, since the ‘70s-‘80s, when it became, let’s say, fashionable. And I am glad that women were somehow instructed about what to expect at birth, because otherwise, until then, they only received instruction from midwives. But at that time, when births were attended by midwives, it was completely different. And no, birth was not a terror and a fear for every woman.

I can honestly tell you that this breathing technique, which I have seen presented in all birth movies, even gave me goosebumps all over my body and I realized that I did not want to go through something like that and there was no way I would suffer or struggle at birth like the last person. And that was one of the clear reasons why, thirteen years ago, I would have chosen elective cesarean with general anesthesia with my eyes closed, because I didn’t want to feel anything, I didn’t want to be in pain. I am very afraid of pain and, indeed, I am very scared of it and because of that I was absolutely convinced that the best option, so as not to go through an image like the one you see now on the screen, would have been elective cesarean. Beautiful, elegant, I would have gone by car to the hospital, I would have given birth, that is, someone there, an on-call doctor, would have delivered my baby by cesarean, and that would have been, in my opinion thirteen years ago, the most beautiful and easiest option.

Well, many things have happened since then and I have learned a lot and I came to want to give birth naturally. And even after a terrible experience at the birth of my first child, in which I was in that image and I screamed, and I yelled, and I had the most, let’s say, profound moments of despair, I realized that yes, birth can be a very intense experience, which for me was like a sister to death. That is, at the birth of my first child, although I thought I was prepared, because I had prepared with a certain method, like Lamaze, there was hypnobirthing at that time, and I really thought that was the ultimate method. And yes, I had trained for birth and I experienced the most horrible and terrible birth, exactly like in this image, with that breathing technique, from the method I was even teaching at that time.

So, what I can assure you is that I can help you not to go through that and not to do everything wrong, as I did. Because that experience of my first birth, which was a near-death experience, I really thought I would die then, because I couldn’t take the pain anymore and I felt that I simply couldn’t and would never be able to give birth to my child, I tried exactly this breathing technique after I had exhausted those from the method I had learned and which had absolutely no, let’s say, connection with the reality I was in and did not help me at all. I also tried this Valsalva method, which literally, yes, made my eyes pop out of their sockets, burst my capillaries, my eyes were bloodshot and bulging. So it was something I will never forget in my life, something I would never repeat and would not wish on anyone.

I promise you that... I will show you, by the way, why this Valsalva technique, which is still taught by most midwives and still taught by certain methods like Lamaze and others, is contraindicated and it is not contraindicated because Ditta Depner says so. It is contraindicated according to the latest studies, which have clearly shown that it is dangerous for a woman to push and strain in the way described by this technique, Valsalva. I will tell you more in the course. This very technique I am presenting to you now, Valsalva, medical studies say is harmful and dangerous, especially for women with hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias, as it can cause strokes or cardiac arrest, which, as you can imagine, is not what we want. And regardless of whether you have problems or not, whether you have hypertension or not or just want to give birth to your child, believe me, I will teach you exactly why not to apply this Valsalva technique and method, which is, let’s say, the recommendation of all midwives and doctors who will tell you in moments when you decompensate how to breathe. That is the problem, actually. Because they use an outdated, dangerous method that endangers the life of the woman and, of course, the unborn child.

Precisely because this is still taught today, in all prenatal education courses, it is taught in medical schools, it is taught to midwives, it is taught by all kinds of people who attend births. So it is the most dangerous method and the one I do not recommend. And you can try it. I will teach you exactly how it is done, that is, how NOT to do it, so you can get an idea of what one means and what the other means. You can even test it at birth. So, by going through the course, you will know which technique I do not recommend and which is contraindicated and which does not help you give birth faster, but on the contrary, does exactly the opposite and also endangers the life of the mother and child. And I will teach you the simple, logical technique, supported not only by female physiology, but by many, let’s say, correlations between the body, psyche, and emotions of a woman.

So, I will show you in this pushing breathing course the amazing similarities between the larynx, that is, this part inside the throat, and a woman’s vagina. And you will see that this correlation will help you understand why not to use that Valsalva technique I told you about and how, in fact, your body helps you in the most miraculous and amazing way to bring your baby into the world as easily as possible, if you do what you need to do. Also in the course, I will show you the law of sphincters, which... We have many sphincters in the human body. Over fifty, in fact. Yes, exactly. Not only in the digestive, urinary, and vascular tracts, but also in the vagina. And then we will make some correlations between the vocal cords, that is, the larynx and your cervix, and between the jaw and your vulva or vagina. So this is another correlation I will explain to you in detail in the course.

I will also explain in the course why the vagina is perfectly built to... allow a baby to pass through and be born. And I will show you what is, let’s say, the emotional cause of a blockage that, let’s say, blocks your baby in labor, right in the vagina. Because there are many women who, exactly at those moments, block their labor and the birth simply stops, after which it ends up with instrumental deliveries. What does that mean? I will explain in detail. Instrumental means birth with forceps, where a clamp is actually inserted into your vagina. The baby’s head is grabbed and literally pulled out. And from there... it’s a disaster. Because when you force and pull the baby’s head, the vagina tears, the cervix tears, many things tear, in shreds. That’s why, yes, I don’t want to scare you. I know it sounds horrific, but this happens in many cases. These are the horror stories you hear from your friends, who swear they will never give birth naturally again because they were literally abused at birth. So I will explain to you in the course why these blockages happen and how to overcome them and especially the breathing technique that will help you relax your vagina.

I will also explain in the course what it means to strain and what it means to listen to the advice of the doctor or midwife who guides you when you are lost and what your body does when you strain and how it tenses the neck muscles and, implicitly, the vagina and how it grips the baby like a vise exactly when you should let go and allow the baby to be born and push it out. So all these correlations I will explain to you in detail in the course. I will explain how to relax your vagina and what this has to do with your cervical muscles. Here. The shoulders, neck muscles, and all the facial muscles. So you will make some correlations that will help you apply the special breathing technique for pushing, understanding the “why,” not just doing it because someone said so. Because, you see, your mind needs to understand why I teach you not to do that Valsalva technique that everyone will recommend if you get lost and forget what you practiced for several months before birth.

The vocalization technique for pushing will give you a relaxed cervix, a relaxed vagina, a relaxed vulva, and that means an easier birth. That’s why, I know, now you are even more curious to find out what you could do, so please watch and... purchase the breathing course that will help you have that beautiful and fulfilling birth that every woman desires. You will learn that this vocalization is part of every woman’s right to the freedom to do what she feels during the intense moments of birth. So I will reveal to you in the course exactly how and what you need to do so that you have the chance to choose exactly what is good for your body and what does your baby a great favor, to be born easily and quickly and not to intensify the trauma of birth.

Because you will see that birth has a fantastic impact on the character and personality of every person. In the basic course and in all the courses I teach, you will see what the emotional connection with labor is. Because birth is eminently emotional. Birth is not just a physiological process. Birth is influenced by all the mother’s feelings and emotions. And now the problem is not that those feelings can be controlled. The emotions you will have because of their intensity are not controllable. And besides not being controllable, they also bring back on stage those emotions unconsciously experienced at your own birth. So, not only do emotions come and overwhelm you, but unconscious memories will also come and overwhelm you from out of nowhere.

That’s why a birth must be prepared not only with breathing techniques, but also emotionally, with all that visible and invisible baggage you feel and will clearly feel, but won’t know where it comes from. These are exactly the things I explore in all my courses and that’s why, a part that will help you have that beautiful and fulfilling birth is the actual breathing technique, which will clearly help you, but the shadow part, the unseen part, also has a very big contribution to, let’s say, the duration and intensity of the birth you will have when your baby comes into the world.

So, vocalization during pushing will be the breathing technique for the moment when your baby makes their appearance in this world. And yes, it will only be effective if you do that breathing technique automatically at that time, without thinking. That’s why it must be practiced daily, but only under a certain condition. This pushing breathing technique is only done at a specific time of day. That’s why it is not a technique that is practiced anytime, anyhow. Because you will find out why. And I will tell you in the course exactly when you can practice it daily, because by practicing it, it will become a reflex. Because if it does not become a reflex, it’s useless to do it two or three times now in the course or then, because it will not have enough weight to... override those overwhelming feelings you will experience in those intense moments of birth.

So, my dear, I am looking forward to you watching this course about breathing techniques, precisely because, by going through this course with me, I will develop each topic with you. So, let’s get to work! Good luck!
