Warm greetings to you, my dear! I am Dita Depner, and I am glad to see you again in this course. In this chapter, I will talk to you about cutting the umbilical cord and about the practices we have in most hospitals. We will discuss what pulsation means and how long the umbilical cord should pulse after the baby is born. I will also talk to you about the role of the placenta in this pulsation after the child is born. We will discuss placental blood transfusion, which passes through the umbilical cord into the child's body, and you will understand the consequence of the modern practice of cutting the umbilical cord immediately after birth. You will find out what happens to the placental blood and understand why all children whose umbilical cords are cut in the first seconds after birth will suffer from iron deficiency anemia for at least the first years of life. I will show you what the umbilical cord looks like after birth, how it pulses, and how it will look progressively at five minutes, ten minutes, up to twenty-five minutes, thirty minutes, when it no longer pulses. You will also see images of children who were allowed to receive this placental blood and children who were deprived of this placental blood transfusion. You will see what a cord cut too early looks like, so you can better understand the mechanism, and you will see what a cord looks like so that you can choose when this is done. You will understand why the umbilical cord pulses and why this pulsation transmits blood in only one direction, and not back and forth as happened during pregnancy. And you will understand what and especially when the pulsation stops and when the placenta completes its role as a supporter of life.

So, let's see a bit about what we are referring to when we talk about the umbilical cord, which is actually the connection between the mother and her baby in the womb. And not only then, but also after birth. About twenty-five minutes after the baby is born, the pulsation of the umbilical cord ends. What you see here in the image is a newborn baby boy. You can see the testicles, which, don't be alarmed, are more swollen in boys due to the effort of being born, but they return to normal within a few hours after birth. The umbilical cord here is flaccid, you see, it is almost white and still connects the placenta to the baby. In the times before our wonderful rush, children were still left attached to the placenta after birth. But that is another chapter. It is called Lotus Birth, and I will talk to you in another video about the benefits of a lotus birth. So, the child can remain attached to the placenta until the placenta is born. There is no danger. It is a natural thing. This is how it happens in all mammals. Only women today do not know, because no one teaches them. That is why it is very important to inform yourself and take a course to learn all these things.

So, the placenta, which has the role of nourishing and oxygenating the baby throughout pregnancy, will complete its life-supporting role when the pulsation ends after birth, at about thirty minutes, and the umbilical cord, after it no longer pulses, becomes white and soft. How can you check this? Simply by putting your hand, your fingers, and pressing on the umbilical cord to see if the pulsation still exists. You will be surprised how strongly the cord pulses, especially in the first minutes after birth, because it pumps about 150 milliliters of placental blood with stem cells into the baby's body. This is your child's rightful blood. These are your child's rightful stem cells, not the cells of some bank that collects stem cells from all over the world, from all children, but the stem cells of your own child, who knows best what to do with them. You do not need to extract them to store them somewhere and then never benefit from them, because you will not be able to afford it. And because, indeed, there are not many doctors who know what to do with stem cells, whether they are used for the baby, the child, or the adult later in life.

As I was saying, about 150 ml of blood, that is, a cup, yes, if we put it that way, will be transferred in the first 25 minutes into the newborn's body, giving them the chance for a good start in life. To help you understand what a cup of blood means for a baby, about 150 ml, I will give you a comparison so you understand what 150 ml of blood means for a baby, relating that amount to an adult. 150 ml for a baby can be compared to about 900 ml of blood for an adult. You know very well, or if you did not know, you find out now that if an adult loses around 900 ml of blood, they are already incapacitated and might need blood transfusions. That is why we do not realize how important this natural, physiological placental blood transfusion is, which happens at every mammalian birth. All mammals make this placental blood transfer, except us, humans, who for over 70 years have not practiced patience at birth, but rush to resuscitate, to speed up, to whip labor, to get the baby out faster, to "help" the mother, to speed up the process, to optimize it. No, that is not what this is about. It is about respecting the child's right to life, to receive their stem cells, to receive those milliliters of blood without us rushing or applying procedures that might create more complications than anything else.

So, those 150 ml of blood, if the child were an adult and you could see it, yes, luckily babies do not have to get out of bed, walk, or talk. They will not show that they are weaker or more lethargic, because they do not need to show us that they have to walk or talk. So, you cannot realize why a newborn is softer or, let's say, sleepier or, I don't know, unprepared for action, because they do not perform any action. Only if you do blood tests will you realize that they lack a significant amount of iron. Iron is blood, yes, in large part. And when we see this in tests, responsible and conscientious pediatricians state that no matter how you supplement a newborn with inorganic iron or even, let's say, through breastfeeding, any kind of loss might be recovered. Know that even after a year and a half of breastfeeding or supplementing with inorganic iron for the child or the mother, it will not modify the newborn's iron deficiency anemia, at least not in the first year and a half of life.

So, we deprive the newborn of these very important 150 milliliters for their proper development. Why do you think nature made a mistake when all mammals keep the umbilical cord intact and wait for that placental blood transfer? And why do we have anemic children and fight iron deficiency anemia even after a year or two? Because we rush. Because we are the only ones who cut the umbilical cord immediately after birth. No, nature did not make a mistake. We, humans, make mistakes, but we do not have time to think about it, because, well, that's the pace. If the cord is cut, as I said, in the first seconds of life, the placenta remains full of the baby's rightful blood, and the newborn's body will suffer this significant loss. As I said, almost a liter, yes? If we, as adults, lost a liter, we could not get out of bed, we would faint instantly. It is about the same thing that happens to our baby, only they do not have a voice to tell us they feel bad or are about to faint.

What do these missing 150 ml mean for babies? As I said before, iron deficiency anemia, lack of plasma. You see, the body of a newborn or a fetus in the womb is not just the body, but is connected to an external organ. The placenta is the baby's external organ throughout pregnancy. It is as if we had an extension. This extension always contains 150 milliliters of blood. The rest of the body will always contain about 300 milliliters of blood. Of course, depending on how much the baby has grown. The more they grow, the more plasma is formed. But mainly, before birth, the baby's body has a constant 300 milliliters, and the placenta constantly circulates 150 milliliters between itself and the baby's body. This does not mean the placenta or the baby ever runs out of blood. There is just a circulation between the baby and the placenta that ensures nutrients, oxygen, waste elimination, and so on, so we always have, in fact, 450 milliliters of blood in the baby's body and the external organ, the placenta, which after birth, after about half an hour, completes its mission and becomes an inert organ that detaches. This detachment would happen after a few days, when the umbilical cord dries up on its own and the placenta detaches, because the umbilical cord detaches from the baby's navel.

So, nature knows how to do this, but we no longer let it follow its physiology, but rush the process. So, when we cut the umbilical cord immediately after birth, we actually deprive the child and the newborn of those 150 milliliters that remain in the placenta. Not only does blood remain in the placenta, which is part of the child's blood circuit, but stem cells also remain in the placenta, because stem cells develop only in the placenta, and the role of these stem cells, which are intelligent cells, is to reach, after the birth process, the child's body. Why? Because they are intelligent cells, they will go exactly to the organs or areas where certain anomalies or disturbances have occurred due to birth, which is intense, yes? And they repair there, because stem cells are intelligent cells that know how to adapt and can become any type of cell. So, we not only deprive the child of plasma, that is, 150 milliliters, but also of stem cells. Unfortunately, as I said earlier, these deficiencies cannot be corrected with any synthetic or natural supplement, not even through breastfeeding, for a long time, a year and six months.

But yes, why not understand and why not stop these aberrant practices that true midwives around the world accuse of rushing and somehow whipping the entire birth process? To prevent this iron deficiency anemia, you just need to allow and respect the pulsation of the umbilical cord for twenty, twenty-five minutes. You can see in this picture how the umbilical cord immediately after birth—see how the baby is starting to turn pink from purple. This is absolutely normal. Their color changes. That is why all babies are born purple. So, there is absolutely no problem. Our mothers who told us, "Oh, you were purple, you looked terrible!" as if you were almost dead when you were born, dear, they did not know that all babies are born purple and regain or change their color to pink or nude, yes, as our skin or defined color, after a few minutes from birth. Precisely because you respect this pulsation, your child will receive both their blood and their stem cells.

How do you know how long to wait? Well, you put your hand on the cord and see when it no longer pulses. Anyway, you will notice that the color disappears and the umbilical cord remains white and flaccid. Here you see how long it takes for those 150 milliliters of blood to transfer from the placenta to the newborn. In the first five minutes after birth, the pulsation is in full swing, you can see with the naked eye how the umbilical cord pulses. If you put your hand, if you put your fingers on the umbilical cord, just like that, you would actually feel the pulsation, and if you wanted to squeeze or stop it, you could not, because the pulsation is very strong. Plus, the umbilical cord is not a hose. Inside the umbilical cord, there is a vein, which is the thickest, you can see the vein, and two arteries that twist around, but not in an empty hose. That hose, let's say, the umbilical cord, has a gel inside called Wharton’s jelly. That gel is like cartilage. Here, in our ears, we have cartilage, so you can understand how consistent this cartilage is, which does not allow these three blood vessels to be squeezed or strangled. So, no matter how hard you press, you will not be able to stop the pulsation.

Here we have at five minutes, at ten minutes in the second image, at fifteen minutes in the third image, at twenty minutes in the fourth image. Around twenty-five minutes, you see that there is no more pulsation. So, the pulsation goes in one direction, from the placenta to the child. That is what is interesting, that after the baby is born, the pulsation is no longer back and forth from the placenta to the child and from the child to the placenta. After the baby is born, the pulsation occurs only in one direction and fills the child with the blood that will empty from the placenta.

Here we have thirty minutes when the cord, compared to the first image, is soft, flaccid, as if it no longer has pressure. Yes, the pressure is gone, the pulsation is over. The child has received their blood and stem cells, and everything is ready for life. Extrauterine life. That is, we are no longer in the womb, we are outside.

And here I have an extraordinary visual example, yes? The difference between an anemic newborn. Poor thing, he was the first, yes? The one who was born first. They are twins. He was the first to be born and is a bit paler. He has a whiter color compared to his brother. And yes, you should know that it is not the difference in the moment of birth, but simply the fact that this child did not receive the blood transfusion from the umbilical cord and placenta, nor the stem cells. And the second baby, the redder baby, baby B, yes? Who benefited from the pulsation of the umbilical cord. And yes, he has color, he is not pale, not faint, does not suffer from iron deficiency anemia. That is, in fact, the huge difference that is visible. But just today I had a discussion with a neonatal nurse who was very upset, in Romania, that all the doctors do not allow, or at least those she worked with at the hospital where she works, do not allow babies to keep or receive that placental blood. And she asked me why this practice exists in Romania? Yes, why? There are many practices, not only in Romania, but everywhere in the world. Unfortunately, it is your right, it is your child's right to ask for time, because you are not asking for anything else. You are asking for twenty-five minutes of respect for your child. No matter what. Because, honestly, in those twenty-five minutes, nothing bad can happen to deprive the child of something important. It is just a matter of patience, of time. Because this pulsation does no harm, but a world of good. But yes, you have to ask for it and you have to be firm or choose the maternity where you will give birth, where this right will be respected. And everywhere in the world, there are maternities that will grant you this innate right to ask this of the medical staff.

Here we have the difference between a cord cut in the first seconds—look how full of blood it is—and a cord cut fifteen minutes later. There is a big difference. You can actually see that, yes, there is still blood, you can see that more blood has flowed, but it is no longer so full of blood. Yes, this is the blood that will never reach the newborn's body.

After birth, the transfer of placental blood is done in one direction, exactly as I said earlier. It is done towards the newborn. What do you see here? A newborn baby with a newly born placenta, in which it is clear that the cord no longer pulses. What you see here is the white cord. What you see here is the cord that has swollen a bit because there is probably fluid, lymphatic fluid. So, when the placenta pulses, all that mass of plasma, blood, and stem cells goes into the child's body. The child's body receives and does not send back, because if it sent back, after the child and placenta are born, you would see blood circulating through it. But the pulsation happens from the placenta to the child, after which it stops and there is no longer any risk or—nature did not design this whole process so that the pulsation happens only in one direction? After the placenta is born and after the pulsation ends, the placenta becomes an inert organ, detaches from the uterus, and is born. So, it is very simple. We will discuss how the placenta is born and what the woman feels when the placenta is born, but that is for another lesson, because now it is very important for you to understand the physiology of birth, so you can claim your rights.

The standard practice in maternities around the world is to cut the umbilical cord in the first twenty seconds after the child is born. How is this done? Well, it is clamped, that is, two clamps are placed, then it is cut at, let's say, a maximum of four inches from the navel. The idea is that these clamps are put precisely to stop the pulsation, because if we cut the umbilical cord directly, without stopping the pulsation, we would be covered in blood, because the placenta would continue to pulse and would actually spray, at the moment of cutting the umbilical cord, the gowns of the doctors or midwives assisting the birth. So, it is clear that we are rushing here. And how beautiful it would be to respect this right of the child to receive their blood? Because nature has never made a mistake. We, humans, make many mistakes. This standard clamping is barbaric, in my opinion, because it leaves the newborn without support for their first breaths of air through the lungs. What does "without support" mean? Why do you think the umbilical cord has the role of oxygenating the child, especially when they make the transition from oxygenation through the umbilical cord at the cellular level to the oxygenation that will happen with the first breath they take? While the child experiences for the first time in their life inhaling air through the lungs, which I understand stings, yes, because until then, their lungs were filled with a fluid similar to gastric fluid and during pregnancy, their lungs were full of fluid and there was no need for any change. Indeed, the diaphragm made an up-and-down movement that actually imitated breathing, precisely because the organ, the lungs, were preparing for breathing after birth. So, the child is going through the biggest change of their life when they are born. Their lungs empty of water right when they are born. It is said that when we pass through the vaginal canal, the shoulders are compressed and that fluid from the lungs will come out through the nose and mouth, after which the first breath will be taken when the baby's nose and mouth touch air for the first time. So, instead of this being a shock and the child having to oxygenate, because the brain must always be oxygenated, otherwise sequelae occur. If the child remains, for example, several good seconds, up to a maximum of 60 seconds without air, major problems can occur. So, it is precisely the pulsation from the umbilical cord that ensures the child's brain oxygenation, supporting them to take this first breath in the time and rhythm they can and need.

There are many examples I keep giving, in which I say that resuscitation of a premature baby is always done with the cord attached. The cord is never clamped. There are thousands of examples where they managed to resuscitate newborn, premature babies who did not have the strength to breathe so quickly after birth and who, after seven or eight minutes of continuous resuscitation, managed to take their first breath and still did not remain with sequelae. Why? Because not for a moment was the oxygenation through the umbilical cord interrupted. So, I also have a question: why would you want to deprive your child of this extra oxygenation source as long as you give them two or three minutes to adjust and have a simple, gentle, gradual transition? And not... Let's hit them. Let's cut the umbilical cord so they breathe faster. Well, we all have this support in life. All mammals are given this life support when they are born. Why would we not want to give our child this extra support? To help them so that these first breaths do not become a trauma, to cut off their oxygenation with major sequelae, if we put it that way, just for what? To follow what is usually done? Without oxygen for the brain, for a few seconds, due to shock, the child could be left with sequelae. The child is left without stem cells. If we cut the umbilical cord, the child is left without 150 ml of their own blood, it is not the mother's. The placenta contains the child's blood. The child is left in a state of shock because the welcome they experience is not a warm and gentle one. The child cries desperately because they do not know what is happening to them. Think that their first touches are brutal. Yes? Look at how they are held. Here is a cute picture, but usually a child is held by the neck. They are pulled out by the neck during a C-section, if... I have found many pictures and videos where they are washed like sacks of potatoes and people laugh, "Look how much they cry!" Well, yes, but you, as a mother, do you not know how to hold your child? And the woman who comes there and takes care of the newborns holds them as if they were objects. Yes? So, why cause the baby who is just being born and coming into this world so many unknowns? Think that they do not know what is happening to them. They are in a state of shock. They do not need even more terror. What do they need? A smooth transition into their mother's arms. That is why the umbilical cord is only about twenty or twenty-four inches. That is half a meter. That is enough. Because they do not need an umbilical cord of eighty feet to go to the neonatal ward. No mammal has an umbilical cord hundreds of feet long, because no one leaves their mother. All babies are placed next to their mother, on their mother, under their mother, in their mother's warmth. That is how it is with mammals and with humans. So, we should also end up in our mother's arms, so we do not cry. So, the shock and terror in this picture is also because the child is separated from their own mother and does not know what is happening, does not know why they no longer have enough oxygen, is scared by the handling, the shock, the cold, the idea of being cold when coming into this world. I need someone to warm me up. Why? Because I, as a newborn, cannot produce body heat. Very simple. Why? Because I was in amniotic fluid, in my mother's womb, which was always heated to about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. So, I did not worry, in my mother's womb, about producing heat. Suddenly, I come into air of about seventy degrees, at most. In the operating room, it is even colder, yes? And suddenly, I am cold. My mother is gone, I no longer receive oxygen, I have to breathe strangely. Those people take me somewhere else. I do not know what is happening to me, yes? And here we have, look, the first trauma that happens after birth. But you? You can change these things. You do not have to let anyone do this to your child, because it is your right to hold them in your arms, to soothe their shock, terror, and this fantastic separation, and to assure them that everything is fine. That is why you do not give your child away. That is why you let the umbilical cord pulse. That is why you leave the stem cells in the child's body and do nothing else but defend their right to life.

That is about it for this lesson about the umbilical cord. See you in the next lesson about birth.
