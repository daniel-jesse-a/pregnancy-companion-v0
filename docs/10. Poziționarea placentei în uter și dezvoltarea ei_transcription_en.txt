May your heart be well, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you at this course about the positioning of the placenta in the uterus. I will tell you more about the placenta, which is the miraculous organ that nourishes your baby in the womb, and we will start with the journey of the egg into the uterus. Then you will see that implantation in the uterus happens within a certain timeframe, and we will talk about the development of this fertilized egg in the uterus. After that, I will tell you a bit about, and especially show you, the anatomy of the embryo from conception until the first trimester. You will understand what the yolk sac and the allantois sac are, which are somewhat the precursors of the placenta. You will learn exactly when cardiac activity begins in your baby in the womb, you will understand how the placenta forms and especially when; you will understand how the placenta develops until the end of the first trimester of pregnancy.

After that, we will talk about the correct positioning of the placenta at the beginning of pregnancy and especially at the end, when it becomes important to know. We will discuss abnormalities in the positioning of the placenta, which are very rare, but it is important for you to know about them. We will talk about placenta previa, which is a rather rare abnormality and is a clear indication for a cesarean section, and you will need to know if this is your case or not. Although I do not believe it is, because ninety-five percent of pregnancies are without problems, and you will also understand the emotional and physical causes of all abnormalities in the positioning of the placenta. Yes, I know, it sounds strange, but yes, we even influence these things through what we think, our conflicts, and so on. Let's get started! So, we will talk about the positioning of the placenta.

To help you understand a bit where the placenta usually positions itself, I have attached an image here where you can see it very clearly. I am showing you with the mouse now on the image about where the placenta attaches in the uterus, but you will understand better in the following images. This is the baby. He is in this amniotic sac surrounded by amniotic fluid, and the placenta is outside this amniotic sac, and from the placenta the umbilical cord forms, which will enter—through the baby's navel—with nutrients and oxygen. What you see here is the diaphragm. You can also see this very thin line that separates the abdomen. Above, we have the lungs, here we have the stomach, here we have the liver, right? Then, the intestines. Here you can actually see the cervix, which is now closed because the baby is in full development. You can also see a part of the mucus plug. Here is the vagina. Here we have the bladder and the colon and anus. So, a bit of anatomy doesn't hurt.

The placenta looks exactly as you see it here in the picture. It is the external organ of your baby in the womb, nourished and oxygenated by the mother. So, everything you eat and everything you breathe as oxygen goes through the placenta to your baby. The placenta is somehow the one that makes the translation, yes, it is the interface between you and the baby.

Let's see a bit what happens after physical conception, in which the fertilized egg travels to the uterus in seven days. What you see here is the egg, uh, one of the two hundred and fifty million sperm will manage to enter and fertilize that egg somewhere in this area. Here we have the ovary, which, let's say, approximately every twenty-eight days, releases an egg. And on the day of fertilization, if it happens exactly when it should, uh, fertilization happens somewhere in this area of the tube. This is the tube that goes to the uterus. The uterus here is shown in section, but it has two tubes, two ovaries that serve it. So, let's say fertilization happens here. Inside the tubes, which here look like rather large channels. But to help you imagine how thin a tube is, I want you to imagine a spaghetti. An al dente Italian spaghetti, not like ours, overcooked and thick. So, an Italian al dente spaghetti. That's the thickness. So, inside the spaghetti, there is a place, yes, where there are little hairs that facilitate the rolling of the fertilized egg, and thus, after fertilization, the fertilized egg begins its journey in stages, day by day, to the uterus.

To understand, on the first day after fertilization, the egg begins to divide. We have two cells, then four cells, then eight. This is already day three or four, then sixteen, and so on. The idea is that around day six or seven, the egg, which is now called a blastocyst, reaches the uterus, so it has continued its journey and will attach to the endometrium. The endometrium that you no longer lose after fertilization. Why? Its role was to embrace and attract the egg to offer it a home. The endometrium is usually eliminated during the menstrual cycle. That's what we, women, eliminate every cycle, ideally every twenty-eight days. But of course, this cycle can happen sooner or later. So, fertilization and implantation in the uterus happen about seven days after fertilization. The blastocyst forms around day five and contains our first stem cells, as you see here in this picture. It looks a bit like a fruit. Which fruit? Surely you realized it's a pomegranate. That's why the pomegranate is considered the fruit of fertility. So, I would actually recommend, even during pregnancy, at least one pomegranate a week if you can, because they're not always available. But if you catch them in winter, hm, eat some pomegranates because they are very nutritious and healthy.

Now let's talk about how the blastocyst implants in the uterine wall, in the endometrium, which we no longer eliminate this time during the cycle, because we no longer have a cycle when we are pregnant. Here we have about seven and a half days from implantation—no, from fertilization, excuse me—where the endometrium embraces the fertilized egg and already begins the formation, let's say, of the placenta. These cells, no, these small blood vessels that belong to the mother go and intertwine—here you can see it better—with what will happen here, like a spongy sponge, because that's what the placenta looks like. And I will show you more pictures of the placenta so you can get an idea of what it looks like and how you can recognize it. And what you see here is the fertilized egg, and you can already see some embryonic layers. This yellow and blue part. What you see here in white is already the formation of the amniotic sac. So, after seven and a half days from fertilization, the child begins to take shape. Yes? It is very small, you can't tell. Not even as big as a grain of rice yet. This is to help you understand that there is no point in going for an ultrasound, because the doctor has nothing to see. It is much too early. That's why I would ask you to be patient and wait at least a few weeks after this fertilization. Please also watch the videos and lessons about ultrasounds, so you know there are risks with ultrasounds, even intravaginal or abdominal, for the fetus, not for you, but for the harmonious development of the baby in the womb. So, please pay attention and watch those videos.

At about nine days, implantation occurs, and you see how this fertilized egg has penetrated even deeper into the endometrium, in a safe place, where we see the amniotic sac, the amniotic cavity where the fluid forms. This will be the baby's body, the one with the blue and yellow stripe. And the yolk sac or vitelline sac begins to form, which contains what? A yolk that will nourish the child—the embryo, yes. What you see here is the beginning of placenta formation, and the placenta will have about eighteen weeks—no, sixteen—to form. So, until then, the embryo will feed and grow from that yolk sac.

Here we have sixteen days. You can already see how the embryo is forming. From the two lines, three layers are actually formed. The cavity where the amniotic fluid forms is created. We have the derm, mesoderm, and endoderm, yes? Here we have the placenta, which is already forming more and more, and the yolk sac that nourishes and grows the embryo. At fourteen days after fertilization, we already have a more promising shape, let's say. The embryo is this blue, red, and yellow one. Blue is like a mollusk, yes, with a tail and a head. Here the eyes and ears, spine, and legs will form. Yes, anyway, this is, hmm, the ectoderm, mesoderm—we'll talk a bit more about this later—and endoderm. The endoderm also contains the yolk sac from which the embryo is nourished. And this turquoise part, yes, because we women know these strange colors, this turquoise blue represents the amniotic fluid, and this part here is actually the placenta that is forming.

Here is the yolk sac from which the embryo is nourished in the first trimester of pregnancy. Look how cute it is! Who does it look like? That's just it, it doesn't look like anyone. So, don't rush to the ultrasound to quickly see who it looks like or to get pictures. Because these pictures, even if they are very cute, they strongly interfere with the harmonious development of all the life-support systems of your baby. So, this is the embryo. This is the yolk sac. This is another sac. The allantois residue sac. Here we have the chorionic sac—you'll see there are several sacs—we have the amniotic sac in which the baby is and which is full of fluid, precisely so the embryo's body doesn't dry out. And we also have a chorionic sac that contains both the yolk sac and the residue sac, and then we have another shell, yes, which is very good as a shock absorber. So, you can jump rope, the baby will have no problem.

The yolk sac will be the source of nourishment until the placenta develops in the uterine wall. This is the yolk sac. You see it here in green, yes? The baby is nourished from this until, look, from the yolk sac, the umbilical cord begins to form toward the placenta. Here we have the development of the placenta. These things, like little yellow crosses, are actually the beginning of placenta formation, which will become larger, and after week eighteen, speaking in terms of ultrasound, the baby begins to feed from the placenta. The yolk sac eventually disappears, and the baby begins to feed from there.

You see, we have again the amniotic sac, the chorionic sac, and, of course, the whole shell, which is very practical against physical shocks. Why do you think it is so important for the baby to develop in an aquatic environment and not in an aerial one? Well, if we were to develop in an aerial environment, we would have to be wetted all the time, so we wouldn't dry out. So, nature chose for us to grow in a liquid environment. The liquid environment also helps with the idea of floating. If we lived in an aerial environment, someone would have to turn us from one side to the other so we could grow harmoniously on all sides, without flattening the side we are lying on. So, this fluid is very well thought out by nature and is the perfect environment for any embryo to develop. That is why the fluid is fundamental, especially in the first months, when we need to develop harmoniously and when we are very small, yes?

Inside the yolk sac—and I show it here with the mouse—the first blood elements are also formed. So, in the sac that nourishes us with yolk, the first blood elements are formed, and the first flow that will be attracted by the baby's body into the empty space of the heart will trigger the start of cardiac activity, and the first heartbeats will begin, at about twenty-two days after conception. That means about three weeks after conception. Attention! Conception does not coincide with the calculation of pregnancy weeks, because pregnancy weeks are calculated by another criterion. When you go for an ultrasound, the first ultrasound you may not do, because in the meantime you found out it's not very okay, the doctor will ask you when your last period was and will want to know the first day of your last period. And from then, he calculates the weeks. So, even if you didn't conceive the baby on the day of your period because you didn't ovulate then, he will calculate those two weeks before conception as if the baby already existed.

So, if I have twenty-two days from conception, that's three weeks and one day, I add another two ultrasound weeks, which actually show when I last had my period, and it will be about five and a half weeks. But I want you to understand that many, many women have been misinformed, or, anyway, the doctor didn't know to tell you better that the baby doesn't have cardiac activity. And the mother was suggested to take a pill to abort. Many of the women who were advised this, however, refused because they said they couldn't take that abortion pill, and two weeks later, going for another check-up, the baby had cardiac activity. That's why I say these early check-ups don't always help, because you might get a result that isn't true, and you might just need to be more patient. That's why I suggest you have more trust in this baby who chose you to be his mother. Because it's very important. Because if he chose you to be his mother, can't you say he trusted you? He took you exactly as you are, with your advantages, disadvantages, and qualities.

So, he trusts you as a mother. Why wouldn't you trust him? That he knows what to do, because you can't do anything except influence him through your stress. So, if you are positive and happy and enthusiastic, you will surely help your baby develop exactly as he should, not creating extra stress for him. So, the conclusion is that it wasn't the heart that started beating, but the blood irrigated the heart and made it start. The conclusion is, as they say, chicken or egg? Blood is the giver of life, not the heart. The heart continues to beat, but blood is life. That's why, whenever we have a problem with blood, we have a problem with lack of zest for life, limited joy, yes, little enthusiasm, because blood means the life in us.

So yes, we are formed from a heart, as you see, the embryo here is a few weeks old, but it is formed like a heart. Here we have the amniotic fluid, we have the amniotic sac, the chorionic sac, and so on.

This is what a baby looks like at eight weeks after conception. Attention, we learned something new! Eight weeks after conception means ten ultrasound weeks. It's clear now, right? Your baby is the size of a bean. You can see the tip of the nose, the ears and eyelids are developing, and the fingers of the hands and feet appear. Here you can also see the umbilical cord. And what is this spongy thing? Well, it's the placenta. And what is this round thing? It's a sac, the yolk sac from which the baby nourishes itself until the placenta takes over. The placenta here is still forming.

Week nine after conception. What do we see here? Circled in black—the yolk sac. What do we see here? The baby with hands, feet, and here is the umbilical cord with the blood vessels that feed with blood from the yolk sac and later form the connection with the placenta. Here your fetus is two to three cm. It's, let's say, the size of a grape. He begins his uncontrolled movements, because these uncontrolled movements, like spasms, help the development of muscles throughout the body. Meanwhile, the pancreas has formed, the gallbladder has formed, and the reproductive organs begin to develop. This means at eleven ultrasound weeks or nine from conception.

Week ten of gestation or twelve ultrasound weeks, your baby is already the size of a strawberry, and the brain grows by two hundred and fifty thousand neurons per minute. Just so you don't think your baby doesn't think or perceive. The neurons record everything. The baby, in the state he is in the womb, when he is born, does not come with an empty brain, but with nine months of experience. Experience that he stores, but cannot rationalize. But it's there. And what does the baby record at the brain level? All the mother's emotions. So, pay great, great, great attention to how you live your pregnancy, to what fears overwhelm you, because I am waiting for you to resolve your fears, and you will see that after you assimilate the theory from this course, you will want to resolve your own birth and the fears that have accumulated there, so you don't pass this on to your child. So, I am waiting for you at the online course you will take with me, live, for healing your own birth, not just yours, but also your partner's. So, come together to the course because you will learn a lot there.

What you see here very nicely is the umbilical cord with that thicker vein and the two tiny arteries that currently serve and nourish the baby. Here we have thirteen weeks of gestation or fifteen ultrasound weeks. The fetus is the size of a medium apple and weighs about four grams. What you see here is his first scarf around his little leg and around his neck, because the baby, moving in his amniotic sac, will always wrap something around his hands, legs, and so on. What you see in the back is actually the yolk sac here and the formation of the placenta, yes? Only your placenta does not form in a void, as shown here, but forms attached to the uterus. So, that's another discussion. But these are the only pictures we have to show you how everything looks from the outside.

Now let's talk about the placenta. The placenta is that external organ of your baby in the womb. Here you can see the umbilical cord, which the baby wraps around his legs, hands, trunk, neck at any opportunity, which is not a danger, because the baby did not come to end his life, but to live. So, his desire to live is maximum, and you shouldn't worry about what he does in the womb, because he knows very well what to do. And here we have the positioning of the placenta in the uterus during pregnancy. This is the placenta. As I said, the baby stays in his amniotic sac, which does not contain the placenta, but from the placenta the umbilical cord forms, which enters the baby's navel. Here we see the amniotic sac with amniotic fluid. Then we have the cervix with the mucus plug and the entrance to the vagina.

Here we see several placenta positions. We have a lateral position, which is very okay, because the most important thing about placenta positioning is that it does not obstruct the baby's birth canal, yes? Because if it were here, we couldn't give birth to the baby. Because the baby must be the first to be born. What you see here is a baby waiting to be born. He is in birth position, with his head forward, hands on his chest, chin to chest, legs flexed, umbilical cord, and here we have a placenta positioned at the top, which again is very okay because the cervix is clear. What else do we see here? The bladder. Think about it, for the baby to come out, he will have to come out with his whole body, and what will he do? He will compress exactly this part of the colon and bladder. We will discuss this when we talk about birth.

Now, this is placenta previa. Placenta previa means that the placenta has positioned itself incorrectly and covers the exit from the uterus, that is, it covers the cervix. This means the baby cannot be born first, but if labor starts, the placenta will come out first because the baby cannot come out. Now, let's think logically. If the placenta has to come out first, how does the baby breathe? Because if the placenta detaches from the uterine wall, it will no longer be able to provide oxygen and nutrients to the baby, and oxygen is vital. You can't leave the baby without oxygen for more than a minute. So, placenta previa is an indication for a cesarean section. There is no such thing as, oh, let's put a cabbage leaf. It's not possible. Yes? There are no universal remedies, no incantations, right? If we have placenta previa, we do not give birth naturally. That's it. No problem. That's why the cesarean was invented, precisely to save the life of the mother and the baby in such situations.

So, if the placenta covers the cervix, you cannot give birth naturally. Anyway, to know if you have placenta previa, it's very simple. During pregnancy, after twelve weeks, there have certainly been problems, bleeding, or other things you have noticed. You can't get to placenta previa without knowing, without having any problem during pregnancy. Ninety-five percent of pregnancies are without problems. Now, why are there more and more cases of placenta previa? Well, placenta previa happens especially in women who have had surgery at the first birth, or the second, or the third, or the fourth. So, anyone who has had a cesarean before this baby in the womb should be careful that after thirty-four weeks, at the ultrasound, to ask for an ultrasound—well, you don't have to ask, because any responsible doctor would propose a short two-minute ultrasound, but no more is needed—to actually see where the placenta is positioned.

If you have watched the other videos about the placenta, you will see that I say there that even you, who do not have an ultrasound machine at home—and you don't need one—can tell where your placenta is. From what? From observation, from the fact that you can tell where your baby never kicks hard with his feet or tickles with his hands. Exactly where you have the placenta. But it is essential and necessary that any woman who has had a previous cesarean, before this new birth, this new pregnancy, investigate, at least after week thirty, if the placenta is positioned where it should be.

Now, why does the placenta tend to insert here and not higher, laterally, or at the top of the uterus? Because usually placentas insert at the top or on the side. They never remain down, near the cervix, to obstruct, let's say, the way out to life. Usually, the placenta, as you have seen in these previous images, in this course, attaches and forms in the uterine wall. Because the uterus at first is the size of a fist, so your fist shows how your uterus looked before pregnancy. Now, from the moment a woman becomes pregnant, the uterus begins to grow and increases about sixty-four times during a pregnancy, because it houses a growing baby. So, the placenta that forms in the uterine wall—if there is a scar from a previous cesarean in the uterine wall, we may have a predisposition there, but it is not certain. That is, you shouldn't think, oh no, I have a cesarean. I will definitely have placenta previa. No. But a cesarean can favor the development of a placental abnormality, in which the placenta, let's say, attaches incorrectly in that area, because it gets caught up in that surgery, which, even if it is sewn up, since there are many layers of skin, muscle that need to be cut, and when the doctor, after a cesarean, cuts all those eight or nine layers of skin, muscle, and so on, on the inside there are always some excrescences. Well, the placenta, when it forms at the beginning of pregnancy, will always be a bit lower. When the uterus grows from a fist to large, the placenta doesn't climb up like little feet, but as the uterus swells, it will be situated higher. Even if it was here at first, when the uterus grows, it will end up being up or lateral, yes? So, it attaches to that previous surgery and can't leave from there and remains somehow stuck there.

That's why there is that very rare chance that it doesn't reposition well because of this. So, placenta previa—indication for cesarean, and if you have had bleeding during pregnancy after twelve weeks—because until twelve weeks the placenta is not yet functional and first trimester bleeding is not related to other bleeding. First trimester bleeding can just be bleeding over the pregnancy, which doesn't necessarily mean an imminent miscarriage. Here it needs to be checked, yes? But bleeding that happens after fifteen weeks of pregnancy already means something else and needs to be investigated.

What is very important: if you have bleeding after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, you need to investigate the placenta—if it is inserted normally, if it becomes accreta. Accreta means it goes beyond the endometrium and enters the myometrium, that is, it goes beyond, um, the uterus somehow. Increta penetrates deeper into the myometrium, and when the placenta is diagnosed, let's say, as percreta, it breaks through the endometrial wall and attaches to organs near the uterus, such as the bladder, yes? And there, with accreta, increta, or especially percreta, we must be very careful, because there the cesarean operation is no longer a normal cesarean, but an operation in which at least another eight or twelve surgeons must be next to that woman giving birth to save her life and the baby's life.

So, it is very important to investigate any kind of bleeding that happens after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, especially if you have had a cesarean before this pregnancy. Or two, or three, or four. Now, I don't want you to panic because I told you all these things, because these are rare placental abnormalities. But you need to know, because it is my duty to inform you about such things that are not okay.

And now what do we see here? Of course, another abnormality, because the placenta covers what? The cervix and the exit into the vagina. So, an abnormality in the positioning of the placenta in the uterus often comes from lesions of a scarred uterus. I told you this before. A scarred uterus means a uterus with a scar. That means a cesarean, a previous cut. Yes? So, it's very clear, that's why placenta previa happens.

And now, here we have a normally inserted placenta. Here we have a marginal placenta, quite low, but look, it does not obstruct. And this can still be delivered naturally, but with care, yes?, so nothing happens. And here we have placenta previa, where the indication is clearly for cesarean.

And now, any kind of abnormality in the positioning of the placenta in the uterus, when there is no previous cesarean, because when we have a previous cesarean, it is a physical predisposition, you can't skip it, it's no longer about emotions or conflicts or other things. So, any kind of abnormality in the positioning of the placenta in the uterus, when there is no previous cesarean, comes from unresolved emotional problems and conflicts of the mother, either consciously or subconsciously. I would recommend, if you have such a problem, to definitely contact a specialist who can help you figure out why your placenta tends to somehow obstruct the exit or natural birth of your child. There is surely a fear somewhere, a fear that somehow manifests, materializes through this placenta previa.

And now, abnormalities in the positioning of the placenta are only diagnosed towards the end of pregnancy. So, there is no point in going to the doctor at eleven to fourteen weeks for him to tell you your placenta is low. We don't care. It can be low, that's how it is, low. There is no point in going at fifteen to eighteen weeks for him to tell you the placenta is lateral. No point in going at nineteen to twenty-two, no point at twenty-three to twenty-six, no point at twenty-seven to thirty. Only from thirty-one to thirty-four weeks or thirty-five to forty can you be told where the placenta is, and then it matters where the placenta is. If from week thirty-four the placenta hasn't moved and is still in front of the exit orifice, in front of the cervix, then clearly we have placenta previa and cannot give birth naturally. But never, if you have a doctor you go to in the second trimester of pregnancy and he starts telling you about placenta previa, saying you have placenta previa, I want you to change him, because that person is not telling—not that he is not telling the truth. Maybe, I don't know, he doesn't say, although I hope that doesn't happen. But it is too early to make a diagnosis that could change in the next two or three weeks. So, placenta previa can only be diagnosed with certainty after thirty-four weeks of pregnancy. And anyway, with placenta previa, there will be problems with the pregnancy and with bleeding. So, you can't be fine and suddenly find out you have a problem. That's just for your peace of mind.

Well, thank you and see you at the next course about birth.
