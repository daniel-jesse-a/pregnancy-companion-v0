Warm greetings to you, my dear! I am Ditta Depner, and I am glad to see you again for a course on epidural analgesia, or peridural, as you may have heard it called. In this course, I will tell you about epidural analgesia. Just a moment... There we go... This is the most promoted form of pain relief or anesthesia during childbirth. There are many hospitals that promise you a pain-free birth because they promote this form of analgesia. You should know that in France, I believe ninety percent of women give birth with this analgesia. The issue of side effects is no longer even discussed. But yes, the promotion is strong, though there are also side effects not only for the mother but also for the baby. I will explain exactly what an epidural anesthesia is, what it does, where and how it is administered, and under what conditions. For example, what the needle looks like, because I have a needle phobia, right? We will talk about the myth that you can have an anesthesia where you can still walk. Yes, so that is a myth. The myth of freedom of movement during labor with analgesia. We will also discuss all the other things that will be attached to you, such as the urinary catheter. Because yes, you will urinate into a bag. I will also tell you about the continuous monitoring of the mother and your baby in the womb, and what a walking epidural actually means—the one that promises you will be able to walk. I will explain why guidance and monitoring are necessary, not just intermittent but continuous, during birth with an epidural. I will also tell you why the epidural is administered only at a certain dilation. I will tell you about what you might feel or not feel during delivery, even though you have received this analgesia. We will also discuss instrumental delivery due to the epidural and the best, least toxic, and side-effect-free alternative, namely water birth, which is the natural version of the epidural. Yes, and by the way, besides the epidural, there are also essential oils that can help—there are plants in this world that, if you know how to use them, can greatly reduce your pain or pain sensations during childbirth.

Epidural or peridural analgesia is the most promoted form of pain-free birth. I have even seen advertisements from various maternity hospitals boasting that you can give birth painlessly with them. Well, yes, but you are not giving birth painlessly because they help you integrate and process this experience in any way. Because there are indeed women who can give birth without acute or very unpleasant pain sensations. To help you understand, I am a fearful person, even though I have given birth at home twice. The first birth was horrible because I had pain sensations. If I were to rate them on a scale from zero to ten, I would give them a hundred, because in those intense moments, I thought I would die, as I could not bear so much pain. It was a medicalized birth, a birth in which I was given oxytocin intravenously. Artificial oxytocin—not endogenous, not produced by my own body. They had to induce contractions because mine were no longer effective, as it was a very long labor. And yes, in those moments when I had no break between contractions, the pain was so great that I truly thought I would die. So I experienced the side of "I never want to do this again," clearly. The second birth, ironically, was also natural, even though I swore I would never go through that again. But it was very different. Different from what? Different from the first. Different from those pain sensations that were killing me, right? And the only difference was that the second birth was also natural, also at home, also supported. But it was a birth, let's say, without stress, without the stress in my head, with more things healed, and it was no longer a repetition of my own birth. Because, as you know, if you have followed me before and if you come to my live course, we will talk about your own birth, which will mirror your perceptions during the birth you are about to have with your child. So we repeat our own birth during our child's birth.

This is a very important thing to mention, and it is not my invention, but epigenetics. It is simply what the brain records and reproduces. So, there are ways to improve not only the pain or the perception or sensations, but also improvement through becoming aware of what happened at your own birth, meaning when you were born by your mother. What perceptions you took from that birth, from that moment when you came into the world, and what the brain will reproduce when this child comes through you into this world. So, it is not just physical things that need to be done for a birth to be beautiful and fulfilling. Many things can be done on the psychological, emotional, and trauma levels—on what we cannot touch but what we feel and perceive. So, it is not all just about what products I take so it won't hurt. Birth can be beautiful. And now you have heard that my first birth was horror, the second was exactly the opposite, and I did not do anything very different. Although, at the perception level, I changed everything—I don't even know how to say it—I effectively changed my attitude towards birth. I changed the idea that I must dominate the pain, that I must breathe in a certain way, that I must do certain things. In the recorded course, you will have access to all these techniques, which, yes, are external, but you will also work on the trauma and emotional side, because that is the foundation. So what did I do differently? I was more connected to my body, I was connected to my child, and the birth did not last sixty-three hours as the first one did. I no longer needed external oxytocin to produce contractions and give birth to my child. Instead, I gave birth in four and a half hours, and it was a birth I will never forget. It was like a kind of revenge, and this revenge allowed me to change my opinion about how painful birth can be when it is medicalized. And I do not blame the medications or the doctors. No. It was simply something I had to go through to understand the difference. That is why I became and remained a prenatal educator, because I realized that you make the difference in the perception of your first or second birth. And you can make the switch here.

Well, so you can give birth without pain. You can give birth beautifully. And regarding the perception of pain, as I told you, on a scale from zero to ten, the first birth was at a hundred, just so you understand how bad it was. And at the second birth, my most acute pain sensations during birth, on the same scale, were around two or three, so the intensity was totally different. I never again felt a ten or a hundred, as I did the first time, but rather a two or three, and I am afraid of pain. I am afraid to go to the dentist because I am afraid of pain, because I have childhood traumas. So it is not that I have a very high pain threshold or whatever it's called. No! Wrong. I do not tolerate pain, I run from pain. But I would give birth a hundred times over, if I didn't have to have a hundred children after those births. So I would gladly give birth in your place, only... It's not quite like that. But for the feeling I had after the second birth—of revenge and pride and wow, I did it!—it was wonderful! That is why I am telling you and opening the subject of analgesia, because anesthesia is not necessary for a pain-free birth. But yes, indeed, conventional medicine only sees the idea of "okay, let's anesthetize if it hurts," right? Let's see what epidural analgesia is about.

First of all, is it a pain-free birth or one with many dangerous side effects? And here, unfortunately, I would remove the question mark, because I am not asking, I will show you that there are many dangerous side effects to this form of analgesia—not only to this one. There are not many other forms of analgesia or anesthesia, which is why I say that these anesthetics themselves have side effects.

What does epidural analgesia do? Look, exactly this blue area you see on this mother's body is the effective local analgesia or anesthesia, which numbs the woman's pelvis and perineum. So the woman no longer feels contractions and no longer feels any sensations in the perineal area. And indeed, epidural analgesia can be a solution for many women. It is a situational solution that offers a mother who is tired during labor longer moments of respite, especially if she has had a very long or stalled labor. Speaking of long and stalled labor, you will see that if you follow all these videos in which I will tell you everything about birth, everything is related to your perceptions, what you have experienced, what you have heard, your fears, and everything related to birth in your mind. So, many of these fears, many of these blockages will dissolve when the mind changes its perception and replaces information with truthful information. That is, not from what I heard from my friends, not from what I heard from my mother who almost died during childbirth. I will give you my example, yes. Not from folklore, but from what actually happens to the body.

Now, let's see what is injected with the help of this catheter into the epidural space of the spine. It is an analgesic cocktail. We will talk about what kind of products are injected into the epidural space of the spine. The idea is that the anesthetic, those anesthetic products, need to reach exactly this epidural space—not further, not higher, not lower—because otherwise, the peridural anesthesia will not happen. For this form of anesthesia, the woman in labor must remain still for several good seconds. Hmm, okay. I don't know if you have gone through labor, but honestly, you never know when the next contraction will come. And, let's say, the key to having a beautiful and pleasant birth is to move, not to stay still. So yes, the anesthesiologist must be able to insert that needle, and then place the catheter in the woman's spine, who must remain still. While this is happening, it will not be strange. It will not be pleasant. I have not done this myself. I cannot explain it to you from personal experience, but I know for sure that I would be a problem patient (laughs) for something like this, because I have a needle phobia. Through this needle, the analgesia will continuously flow, creating numbness in the pelvis. So it is not an injection that gives you anesthesia, but a needle that is inserted at a certain spot in the spine, after which a catheter is introduced through which, like an IV, the anesthetic will continuously flow. That is the needle, I don't know. It is long. I look at my palm. So if someone chased me... I mean, no. If I saw that needle, I would run. (laughs) But again, I don't want to scare you now, but honestly, it is... I can't lie to you that it won't hurt or that it will be nice. No, that needle does not look nice.

So, after the epidural needle is inserted, a catheter will remain there permanently, so that the anesthetic can flow continuously to produce analgesia. So it is not just a prick, it is something that must be maintained continuously.

The epidural and the story or myth of freedom of movement. What you see here is a woman's body covered with a sterile field, and this string or, anyway, this little tube coming out of the woman's spine is exactly that epidural, which is connected to the little bag with anesthetic that will continuously flow into the space between the vertebrae. So you can't really walk around, because there are more things coming, so you are pretty much confined to bed. This is what anesthesia looks like. This is how things are stuck or not on your back, then you get these other bands, this brown one and this gray one. I will explain in a moment why, but basically you are pretty much forced to stay in a certain way and not move much, because more things are coming your way. Besides having the epidural placed in your back, you will also have a urinary catheter placed. That is, this little balloon is inserted into your bladder, and again, it will not be pleasant. Through the urethra—it's a scary movie. Why? Because you no longer have control over your pelvis, and you might urinate on yourself. So yes, you will have a little bag to urinate into. The bag will either be attached to your leg or, if not, to the bed. So you already have two little bags you have to drag around if you want to move. So that story with The Walking Epidural is a nice story, but it doesn't really apply. And all these interventions are not nice. A woman should not suffer when giving birth. Birth is not a surgical intervention on all possible holes. Excuse me.

From the moment the epidural is administered, as I mentioned before, I was talking about that brown band and gray band. You will be continuously monitored—yourself with the gray band, which measures the intensity of contractions, and the baby will have this brown band, with this ultrasound device. Yes, I talked about ultrasounds, and it is important to understand what ultrasounds mean for the baby, especially—the baby's heart will be monitored with this brown band. So, besides being pinned down on your back, you will also be pinned down on your front, and you will have a urinary catheter, so maximum fun for being able to move during contractions. But yes, indeed, you will no longer feel contractions, and you will not feel anything or almost anything. This continuous monitoring, I have explained it. Here we have a pink band, which monitors the mother's contractions, and the blue band monitors the baby's heartbeat. Why is it monitored? Because from the moment this analgesic is administered, the fetal heart rate can suddenly change. What does it mean for the baby's heart rate to change? It means the baby goes into fetal distress, which gives you a few minutes—not you, but the doctors—to deliver the baby safely through emergency surgery, by C-section. So there is no epidural without these continuous monitorings. Why? Because they are dangerous—due to the anesthesia flowing through the catheter in the epidural space, the baby can have adverse reactions and go into fetal distress, which no longer allows the mother to give birth naturally, and the baby is delivered within a few minutes in an emergency to save its life. So yes, this is one of the risks.

So, as I said, this is about the freedom of movement during labor after an epidural. You can turn from one side to the other, and that's about it. But usually, women who end up requesting an epidural, if they have not been misled, are those who are tired and exhausted after long, stagnant labors where clearly not everything was working as it should. Yes, again, huge psychological and emotional blockages, and that's where it all comes from. So, in fact, everything that happens during birth is on an emotional basis and happens here, in the mind. But yes, if we do not connect the mind to the body's symptoms, we cannot make the connection between the two. A mother with an epidural will not be allowed to walk, because otherwise the baby cannot be monitored, which can be dangerous. So, maybe they let you do two laps, but otherwise you are not allowed, because the baby must be continuously monitored. So, regarding the walking epidural, meaning the epidural through which you could walk all the time, it is an analgesia in which opioids are administered, yes? And indeed, you cannot really walk because you are also given analgesics that block your body's motor function. And yes, the baby's safety is needed, which is not up for discussion.

After an epidural, the mother will have a guided birth by others. Who? The doctor, the midwife, whoever is there... Because from the moment the epidural is administered, she no longer feels anything. And, obviously, her body does not respond because it is anesthetized. That is why she needs monitoring, and the baby needs monitoring. She is monitored, and that means that all contractions, when they start, will be seen on the screen, on the Doppler or ultrasound screen. And then the doctor will tell her, if she is in the pushing stage: "Okay, now please push." So it's like watching an American movie—and these are the movies, right?—where you have surely seen a pregnant woman who, instead of knowing what to do, is told when to push. The famous "push" movies. It's like having three cheerleaders telling you what to do and when to do it. That's kind of the feeling you will have, because you will not feel anything. And even when you are told to push, you will contort yourself to try to push, but you don't really know if you are pushing, because you can't feel it. And you don't know if your muscles are listening to you. And usually, yes, there is a nonsense here. You cannot control something you have removed control from. It's like dental anesthesia. After, let's say, you had anesthesia on this side, right? You might bite your gum or your cheek, and at that moment you don't realize it. But afterward, you might taste blood in your mouth because you bit so hard that, yes, you made yourself bleed. The exact same thing happens with this control. "Come on, push now!" but you don't actually feel that you are doing anything. And yes, this is a big problem with births with anesthesia, because you no longer have any control as a mother, and the baby is also somehow interrupted in its communication with the mother, which was instantaneous. And yes, the baby will feel very alone in this process, because the mother is no longer collaborating.

Now, why is the epidural recommended only at five to six centimeters dilation? Here we have several types of anesthesiologists who will come to sell you their epidural, because, well, they sell the epidural and receive their salary based on how many they have sold. They have a base salary as anesthesiologists, but mainly, they earn if they do epidurals. So, of course, in any hospital, there will be an anesthesiologist who will come and present it to you on a tray, as if bringing you candies, saying: "Come on, what would you like to do now? If I give you anesthesia, you will feel very good and give birth quickly and have no problems. Why suffer?" These are the classic lines they use. Now, they say they wait until five or six centimeters dilation. Why? Because the body needs to start this process at a certain rhythm, because when anesthesia is administered, contractions no longer occur. Why? Because they have been anesthetized. So the dilation process stops. Because what do contractions do? They dilate. They dilate the cervix, which must open so the baby can enter the pushing stage and the mother can push the baby out, right? So why not give the epidural from the first contraction? Well, if we gave it from the first contraction, the body would not react, and then we would have to give the woman some products that are not from her body, of course, artificial, let's say, to produce those contractions. So we let the body start at five or six centimeters dilation, administer the anesthesia or analgesia, so that there is not much left until full dilation and the baby descends. Because this analgesia should not be kept on non-stop and for a long time, as it greatly influences the baby, especially, and the mother to a lesser extent, as the mother has fewer adverse effects that she cannot manage compared to the baby. The baby, being brand new, with a brand new liver, does not metabolize those toxins and opiates from the anesthesia the same way. So, at five or six centimeters, if you have been good, you will get anesthesia. Just kidding. If you want it, of course. And then you will have a period during which they will monitor to see if things are progressing or not. Usually, after anesthesia is administered, your contractions stop. They will administer you porcine oxytocin, meaning oxytocin not made by your body, which produces contractions, but oxytocin of animal origin, from sows. Yes, I know, it sounds sexy. I know, it's awful. The idea is that I received this oxytocin and... It's not that it's special, this is what is administered, there is no other. It caused me contractions so painful that, as I told you before, I was screaming. I was screaming in pain. So animal oxytocin produces mechanical uterine contractions that hurt a lot, because they are no longer supported by hormones that reduce pain sensations. So, at five or six centimeters, it is administered. After that, they tell you stop, total anesthesia, we don't know what else to do. The hormones that actually start contractions calm down and say, "Hey, we have a situation we don't know, so we stop." We wait. So, when humans intervene, meaning the anesthesiologist, he must take care of the birth process from there on, to make it progress, otherwise it is dead. Nothing happens. Contractions stop. Birth stops. Then humans intervene and induce. They induce contractions to induce dilation. The woman does not feel the pain because she is anesthetized, but the pains are much greater than when the body is doing its own thing with its own hormones. And when it gets close to delivery, meaning when the cervix is fully open and the baby's head passes through the cervix and slides into the vagina, from there we have a few more centimeters for the baby to be born. Exactly at those moments, when the cervix is fully open and the baby is pushed by those now artificially created contractions, it will slide into the vagina, and the woman is invited: "Now, push!" But she, not feeling anything, will not know how to push effectively. She will do (makes a sound) Is it good? She doesn't feel. At that moment, the anesthesiologist reduces the epidural. Like with an IV, they turn the little wheel, and then it drips less often, and the anesthesia is reduced. The woman starts to feel contractions and will collaborate. At which point the anesthesiologist will say: "See, if I hadn't given you that anesthesia, it would hurt now anyway!" and she says: "Oh, it hurts even so!" "Well, if you hadn't had any!" Here is a big misinformation, because when epidural analgesia is administered, the body's endogenous hormones that produce local anesthesia—such as estrogen, progesterone, which create and cause local anesthesia in the pelvic area—disappear. Then we have endorphins, which also greatly reduce pain. So, all these hormones, at some point, when we anesthetize, they disappear, and they no longer act. So the woman is on her own. It's as if no one is helping her from the inside anymore. That is why she depends on the anesthesiologist's skill, on all the pharma products that anesthetize, induce, and so on. That is why, during delivery, when the epidural is reduced, the woman will feel quite a lot of pain, and the doctor will say, "See, it's good I gave it to you, otherwise it would have hurt even more!" This is a lie. It would not have hurt more, because she would have collaborated internally with her body, and this fantastic pain would not have occurred. So yes, that is why the epidural is given at five or six centimeters dilation.

There are also cases where... There are cases where doctors, to calm women who are very afraid of birth, give anesthesia even earlier. Here, honestly, I would not want to go into details, because the risks are very, very high, and neonatologists hate such decisions, because they know how dangerous it is for the baby. And usually, there is always a declared animosity between neonatology and anesthesia. They don't really get along, because they know that the actions of some influence the outcome for the babies cared for by others. So yes, epidural anesthesia has risks, and I will talk about the risks in a moment.

As I mentioned earlier, from the moment the epidural is placed, the mother will feel contractions only if she needs to collaborate and feel what is happening in her body to help with the birth of the child. So she will feel contractions only if she needs to collaborate. That is, the little wheel where the drip delivers analgesic into the spine is reduced. So, usually, they wait until delivery, yes, to collaborate. And then the woman feels pain and says, "Oh, it's good I got the epidural!" Yes, but you should know that you actually feel it because your body is no longer helping you, because you have confused it with that whole cocktail... Why is pain still felt before birth, even though epidural analgesia was administered? Well, I explained this. The woman feels pain because the anesthesia is reduced, and her body starts to regain its senses, and hormonally, the woman is not helped to reduce the pain. That is why she feels pain before birth, even with an epidural. So, women who gave birth with an epidural actually had painful births, because it is not simple even with an epidural. And yes, hormonally speaking, it will be more difficult.

Usually, unfortunately, a birth with an epidural comes with an instrumental birth, which is very traumatic for both the baby and the mother. For the baby, because regardless of whether it is delivered with a vacuum extractor—a device that creates suction and the baby is pulled out by the head—or with forceps, which is like a clamp that grabs the baby and pulls it out. And for the mother, even if she has anesthesia, the tissues are damaged, and even if they are anesthetized, they are not prepared for birth. Why? Because hormonally, she no longer has support. So yes, unfortunately, let's say, many births with epidurals come with instrumental births. So yes, the best and most beloved option is water birth, because it is the healthy alternative to chemical analgesia, has no side effects, and is the most appreciated, easy, and gentle birth for both mother and baby. There are studies showing that of all women who gave birth in water, very few requested anesthesia during water births, because the pain sensations are so reduced that you no longer feel the need to ask for an epidural or other types of anesthetics.

So yes, I recommend it, especially if this is your first, because there is no point in struggling to reach your fifth birth to realize that a water birth would have been beautiful. Honestly, if I were to give birth again, my first birth was on land. The second birth was in water. I wouldn't think twice about choosing water birth again. It is totally different, and water is healing. And yes, water relaxes. Water eases all that work during labor. So yes, we have an alternative to the epidural. We have water births, and in the next video, I will tell you about the negative effects of the epidural on the woman's body and on the baby. Thank you.
