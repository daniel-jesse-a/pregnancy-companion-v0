Hello, my dear! I am Dita Depner and I am glad to see you again for this module about the baby and their development from conception to birth. Today I will present to you, through images... Today I will show you, in images, from physical conception to the first day, what happens with the embryo and the cells that will be fertilized. I will talk to you about the zygote, the morula, the blastocyst. I know it sounds like Chinese, but these are the stages until your baby implants in the uterus. We will discuss the formation of the embryonic layers. I know it may not seem interesting, but believe me, you will learn a lot and you will be able to visualize your baby in the womb, to see what they look like, so you won’t have to run to so many ultrasounds and disturb them while they are developing harmoniously. I will tell you when the baby’s cardiac activity begins, so you don’t go too early and end up disappointed that nothing is visible or that the heartbeat cannot be seen or heard. We will talk about the protection systems in the uterus, because your embryo is super protected there. And I will show you the pregnancy illustrated from four weeks to birth. Let’s see how your baby forms from conception to birth. I would be happy if you brought your partner to this course, because it is an interesting course that might be useful for him as well. Because yes, surely he is also very curious to see his little one in the womb, not just in some ultrasound images. By the way, I highly recommend that you purchase the course about ultrasounds, so you don’t overdo it with ultrasounds during pregnancy, because they do not help, but rather disturb the development of the embryo and fetus during these nine months of pregnancy. And please, do not forget that anywhere in the world, only two, maximum three ultrasounds are recommended throughout the entire pregnancy. So, if you have done a lot so far just to see your baby and connect with them, I would recommend you find other ways to connect, and this illustrated course will help you connect on another level with your baby, not necessarily through a strange picture from an ultrasound. 

Now, coming back, let’s see what physical conception means. Physical conception only takes place when all other conditions are met. That is, besides physical conception, there are other conditions for conception to occur. There are spiritual, vibrational, and energetic conditions. You might ask: “Come on, what is this spiritual stuff?” Well, it’s very simple. The child comes as a soul. They do not come as a baby. Yes, they will have the appearance of a baby. But the child is the one who chose you to be their parents. And this choice was not a random one, where they just pointed a finger and said, “I want these ones.” No. They studied you, researched you, discovered what they could learn from you, what challenges they might face from you, what helps them in their mission, and these are the criteria for which a soul chooses to incarnate in a certain family. So, there are spiritual conditions, because no one comes just for themselves and no one comes just to live, wake up in the morning, eat, work, and go to sleep. We come with a mission. And so, our missions must at least be adjacent, common, or supportive. 

Now, there are also other conditions: vibrational conditions. Because, you see, physical conception, when two people make love and the sperm fertilizes the egg, is not just that. Because even if, let’s say, we have sex at the right time, when ovulation occurs, it doesn’t always happen. There are people, couples, who, after years of trying, cannot conceive, even though they measure their temperature, know when ovulation is, everything is fine on paper, medically speaking, they are fit to have children. But vibrationally, something doesn’t work, because on their vibration, maybe that child is not coming yet. Maybe the soul that is to come into their family wants them to reach another point, to develop more, to know themselves more deeply, to change their lifestyle, to take better care of themselves. Because it is not enough to conceive physically, as vibration also brings a significant chance for this to happen. And then there are the energetic conditions, where energy means what sets things in motion. For example, if we have a couple where the woman is exhausted, dissatisfied with her job, her life, upset, depressed, she will have a lower chance of conceiving because, energetically, she cannot carry, she does not bring, she does not contribute with enthusiasm, with joy. Energetically speaking, she is too weak, not physically, to carry and offer that energetic explosion that happens when the egg is fertilized. So, even if, let’s say, the egg is found by those sperm, there might not be enough energy at conception, because energetically, maybe the man was not in his best shape either. Maybe the woman was not in her best shape either. And then, their meeting is in vain. Because that energetic “ka-boom” does not occur, I don’t know how else to call it. So, physical conception happens when all the other conditions are met: spiritual, vibrational, and energetic conditions. This is just to help you understand why sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, or why maybe it didn’t work until a certain point and then it did, or what happened that it didn’t work for years.

Now, the process of conception at the energetic and vibrational level lasts about twenty-four hours, for the physical fusion and the exchange of genetic information between the sperm and the egg to take place. What you see here is a sperm that has just managed to penetrate the impenetrable shell of the egg. Why is it impenetrable? Because, ironically, the shell of any egg is not penetrable. But what allows that sperm to enter? Well, it’s not about the sperm. It’s not about the tools it has to dig and break that impenetrable shell, but about the egg’s acceptance to change the chemical composition of its shell and allow a single sperm to enter. Interesting, right? It is the egg’s acceptance to receive a sperm. And now that the sperm has entered, fertilization has occurred and we have day one, you see it there in its nest. Day one, when the zygote forms, that is, your baby is in full formation, this takes twelve to twenty-four hours. It is the cell that results from the union of the sperm and the egg. From that moment of union, cell division begins. We have two cells, four cells, eight cells, sixteen cells, thirty-two cells. You see how there is an evolution, right? On the fourth day, when we have sixteen cells, the morula, which, if you look closely, might resemble a fruit—mulberry, right? That’s what morula means in English. It forms four days after fertilization, when the eight cells multiply into sixteen. What is interesting so far in this development and replication is that all these cells develop inside a membrane, without separating, as happens a bit later, in the next stage. So they are compact, all in the same place. When the blastocyst forms, that is, on the fifth day, this blastocyst contains our first stem cells. You see that they are already arranged differently. And now, a question: What fruit does the blastocyst resemble? It looks like a pomegranate. That’s why the pomegranate is considered a fruit of fertility, so that it resembles, right? There are many fruits that resemble different organs in our body. I’ll give you just one example: the walnut and the brain. And it is said that walnuts nourish the brain.

Returning to fertilization, I want to show you some images to help you understand a bit what happens during fertilization. What you see here is a section of a uterus with the corresponding fallopian tube, which goes to the ovary. The woman’s ovary releases an egg every twenty-eight days, theoretically, and fertilization happens when the egg is here, and the sperm come from an ejaculation that contains about fifty million sperm. When fertilization occurs, the journey begins, because this egg, being round, will roll down the tube until it reaches, on its journey, on the seventh day, the uterus. So we have cell division. Here they divide on the second day. Then they divide into four, eight, sixteen, thirty-two. The blastocyst, which on the seventh day reaches the uterus and will be implanted in the endometrium. That is, the endometrium will be the bed where the fertilized egg will find its warm and good place. The implantation of the blastocyst happens starting from the seventh day, exactly as I showed you, and this good bed is the endometrium, which, because we are pregnant, will no longer be eliminated with the menstrual cycle. So the endometrium, which month after month is eliminated with menstruation, will now nest this fertilized egg and become its home.

Now, what do we see here? We see the amniotic sac. And these two, I don’t even know what to call them, purple and yellow colors. These two lines will constitute the embryo. But not now, a bit later. But this is what it looks like. Good. Two or three days after implantation, things already change. The embryo still has no shape, but these two layers become increasingly compact. The amniotic fluid forms, the yolk sac forms, from which the embryo will feed until the placenta, which is now in full formation, is complete. From the beginning of the second trimester. Now, a few more days, another week later—not a week, more than a week, about ten days after implantation in the endometrium, we already have major changes. The placenta is in full formation. The embryo starts to take shape. It’s no longer two lines, two layers. We have the amniotic fluid forming at the top and the little yolk sac from which the embryo will feed until the placenta is ready. So, you see how from the seventh day to ten days later, many things are already forming inside the uterus.

Now let’s talk a bit about the embryonic layers. Especially those who study German New Medicine will understand why and how the body forms. For the others, it’s a very interesting thing, because we have three layers in this genesis of the embryo. What you see here—yellow, green, and blue—is the formation of the embryo. What you see in purple with these little antennae is the formation of the placenta. So, let’s start with the green layer, which is the embryonic layer. The ectoderm is the outermost layer. The ectoderm is made up of the earth element and will become the nervous system, sensory organs, skin, hair, and external sexual organs. Now, the mesoderm is the connecting element between earth and water and will constitute the skeleton, circulatory system, heart, muscles, kidneys, and reproductive organs. And then we have the endoderm, which is made up of the water element, and from the endoderm we will have the yolk sac from which the embryo feeds until the placenta is ready. From this endoderm, the digestive and respiratory systems, automatic reactions, and vital organs will develop. So this is what the embryo looks like, and all these layers and embryonic sheets are responsible for certain functions to develop the human being later.

Now, at fourteen days after fertilization, the embryo looks like this. To understand which part is the embryo, it’s this blue, red, and yellow part. We have ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. So, you see that the head is already starting to take shape, right? Here we have the yolk sac. The entire embryo is surrounded by amniotic fluid, because it is very sensitive and needs fluid for hydration to grow. And the placenta is in full development on this side, towards the endometrium. Good. Now, the yolk sac is the little bag with yolk and is the embryo’s energy reserve until the placenta forms. Look how big the placenta already is. But it is not functional yet, it is just forming. Until then, the embryo feeds from the yolk sac. That’s where the first blood elements form, and the first blood flow will later be drawn into the empty space in the embryo. Here is the embryo, its little eye. Here you have a little hand, a little foot, and the spine. So, from the yolk sac, the blood flow will form and be drawn into the embryo. Thus, the start of cardiac activity is determined, which actually triggers the first heartbeats. At about three weeks after conception, in other words, the embryo is a human heart. But now a very cute question: which came first, the heart or the blood? I know the heart is a little engine that pulses, but you should know that the blood gave it life and made it beat. So blood represents life, and the blood started the little heart engine and it began to beat about twenty-two days after conception. Here, you see again the embryo surrounded by amniotic fluid. Here you have the amniotic sac and also the chorionic sac, which you can see very well here. The embryo is super protected in the mother’s womb. That’s why, even if the mother does extreme sports or runs, it will not disturb the perfect development of the baby.

Here we have the embryo, which already looks a bit like a primate, with little eyes, a spine. The limb buds haven’t appeared yet. It is surrounded by amniotic fluid, surrounded by the amniotic sac, and in the next sac, the chorionic sac, which you see here as I show you with the mouse now. In the chorionic sac, there are two little sacs: the yolk sac from which it feeds and the waste sac. So, nutrients come from the yolk sac, and waste will be deposited in another sac, the allantois, the waste sac. What does the amniotic sac do? The amniotic sac protects the embryo in fluid and prevents dehydration. I’ve told you before that the child cannot be watered like a flower, so they must grow in an aquatic environment. The chorionic sac helps with gas exchange and protects the yolk sac and the allantois. The eggshell protects against physical shocks. So, we have many layers and protection systems so that the baby grows perfectly. Now I want to ask you why you think the baby, the embryo, must grow in a liquid environment? Besides the fact that yes, we must protect the embryo and prevent its dehydration. There is a reason why it has so many protective sacs and a shell like an egg, because it needs to float in liquid to develop evenly all over. For example, if it were in an aerial environment, it would probably stick to something, right, stick to one side. And then that side could not develop harmoniously, as the side that is free floating in liquid does. So, this is the best option. The child, the embryo, must float in amniotic fluid to develop harmoniously in all parts.

Here you see an embryo at four weeks after conception. That means about six ultrasound weeks, because the ultrasound measures not from conception, but from the last cycle, when the baby did not yet exist. So, four weeks plus two weeks when the baby did not exist. So, four weeks from conception, six weeks from the last cycle. The arm buds, leg buds, and brain development begin. To get an idea of how big a baby is at six weeks, it’s the size of a grain of rice. So, there’s no point in going before six weeks or even at six weeks to see what the baby is doing on ultrasound. Because it doesn’t help, it’s very small. It’s the size of a grain of rice. What do you want to see? If it looks like someone, you’ll see that later—now it’s too early.

At six weeks from conception, the heart is already beating at about 140 beats per minute. The kidneys, liver, lungs, rudimentary digestive system, eyes, ears, and nose are forming. The little nose is around here somewhere. So, what you see here: the umbilical cord is already forming, going to the placenta, and the yolk sac is somewhere in this area. You see the spine is still very curved, giving the impression of a tail, but no, it will retract and will no longer look like a primate.

At eight weeks from conception, that is, about ten ultrasound weeks, the baby becomes bigger. It is now the size of a bean, and the tip of the nose is outlined. The ears and eyelids develop, the fingers and toes appear. What you see here is very beautiful: the umbilical cord with the three blood vessels that are fed from the yolk sac. And here you can already see how the placenta is actually forming. What you see here is the amniotic sac. 

By the age of twenty-eight days, that is, when the baby is one month old or, yes, twenty-eight days old, the foundations of all systems that make up the human body are laid. What you see here, the umbilical cord comes from the navel. This is the yolk sac. Here is the baby. The brain is developing, starting to take somewhat human shapes, but it still doesn’t look exactly human. In the ninth week from conception, the embryo is two to three centimeters, that is, the size of a grape, and begins uncontrolled movements, like little jerks. Why? These uncontrolled movements help develop the muscles and grow. Meanwhile, the pancreas and gallbladder have formed, and the reproductive organs begin their development. What you see here in the black circle is the yolk sac, and here you can see very nicely the umbilical cord and probably two blood vessels.

The tenth week of gestation means twelve weeks, when your belly will be twelve weeks. You can see very nicely the umbilical cord with that thicker vein and the two thinner arteries. The baby is already the size of a strawberry, and the brain grows by 250,000 neurons per minute. You can already see little feet, hands, eyes. Yes? It’s getting bigger.

At thirteen weeks of gestation, that is, fifteen ultrasound weeks, the baby is the size of a medium apple and weighs about four grams. Here I want to show you how easily the baby wraps the umbilical cord around their limbs. They will turn and untangle and get tangled in it many times until birth. That’s why about 80% of babies are born with a cord loop, which is absolutely normal and not an indication for a C-section. Speaking of myths.

At twenty-seven weeks from conception, the baby will suck their finger. This is a picture taken from the womb, and most babies suck their finger, so they are already starting to explore themselves. Everything is born from the void. Life can only develop from emptiness, and all the pictures you have seen so far were taken in the intrauterine environment by photographer Lennart Nilsson. You can even write down this name to look up some beautiful pictures of babies that this photographer, passionate about the womb, managed to bring to humanity, so we don’t tire ourselves so much with the disturbance from ultrasounds just to see our own little one.

Thank you, and I’ll see you next time at the following course. (music not included)
