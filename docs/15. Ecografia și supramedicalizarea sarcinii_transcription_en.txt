Hello, my dear! Welcome to a recorded course about ultrasound and the overmedicalization of pregnancy. I am Ditta Depner and I am glad to see you again. Today, I want to talk to you about the risks of ultrasound during pregnancy and about a topic quite frequently encountered, especially in Romania, namely the overmedicalization of a pregnancy that, most of the time, is unnecessary and lacks well-founded medical reasons. We will discuss ultrasound after the pregnancy confirmation test. I will also talk to you about those pregnancies wrongly diagnosed as candidates for abortion. I will also discuss ectopic pregnancies and, especially, the fear women have that has been induced by these ectopic pregnancies, which, yes, are dangerous, but happen quite rarely. We will talk specifically about the symptoms a woman experiences when she has an ectopic pregnancy. I will also talk about nuchal translucency or the first ultrasound test, which is done around eleven weeks. And yes, I will tell you that ultrasound during pregnancy is not a routine test for every pregnant woman and it is not something that should be done en masse. Yes. I will tell you about the risks in the first trimester for the fetus, because the embryo is in full development, and ultrasound has quite a few adverse effects. I will also talk about false positive anomalies wrongly detected, which cause real dramas in families. And I will also give you some recommendations for your ultrasound investigations, if you need them. So, welcome to this course which, yes, will bring you some very important information about ultrasound in pregnancy.

We are witnessing, especially in recent years, in the last ten years, an overmedicalization and over-technologization of pregnancy. This over-technologization of pregnancy, you should know, has fewer benefits than one might think. Because it greatly influences the emotional state in which the baby grows in your womb. Because, as it turns out, the mother's state is the most important for the safe and harmonious development of the baby in the womb. But this is rarely discussed, and women are far too little supported in such moments, especially during pregnancy.

Ultrasound is, theoretically and practically, the first action after the pregnancy test for any woman. After she takes the test and sees it is positive, the first thing, we quickly call the doctor to make an appointment. Today's woman cannot even imagine a pregnancy without ultrasound, which has already become a norm. That is, we have to see. The problem is that very few women realize that after a positive pregnancy test, they should wait at least a few more weeks before investigating anything. Because at the moment we find out we are pregnant, the embryo is not even two or three weeks old. At that gestational age, it is not even the size of a small grain of rice, so it is almost invisible. And the sooner we go to the doctor, the more likely we are to receive false-positive or disastrous diagnoses, because there is nothing to see yet. So please, after you find out you are pregnant, do not rush so much, because there is nothing to see. And wait, because the baby knows what to do.

Now, let's see with what device that pregnancy confirmation ultrasound is done, which is the guaranteed subscription to weekly ultrasounds. Any skilled doctor who needs consultations, because during a pregnancy, the medical world ends up earning more money than if we give birth with that doctor. Because for nine months, these consultations are worth it and, yes, they add up to a lot of money. Regardless of whether you think you are not paying for them, that you have a subscription somewhere, or that you have to actually take money out of your pocket. Regardless, you are still paying. The money comes from taxes, salaries, and other things. So, the pregnancy confirmation ultrasound, because it is so tiny, can only be done with a transvaginal ultrasound, which is actually the most dangerous. I will explain more why. Because, if we did it on the belly, there are more layers of skin that somehow surround the baby—the belly, the muscles. Yes, there are quite a few tissues before the ultrasounds reach the baby. But, being introduced into the vagina, exactly as you see here and I show you with the mouse, the baby, who is somewhere in the uterine wall, yes, in the endometrium, will be very close to these ultrasounds, which, yes, we will talk more about, have many side effects, especially on a developing embryo.

So, who will give you a subscription? A doctor who operates on such non-ethical principles and effectively plays with the emotional vulnerability of a pregnant woman, of a future mother. So, usually, because the pregnancy is so small, the transvaginal ultrasound can only tell you if it sees something. There are many cases where pregnancies that later proved to be perfectly viable were wrongly diagnosed as candidates for abortion. Why? Nothing could be seen. Or the sac was empty. The embryo had no heartbeat, nothing could be seen. There are hundreds of cases where mothers were recommended to abort. Because of this, they were given that pill. However, in many cases that I personally know, because women write to me, these women refused the abortion, and just a few weeks later, the baby was perfectly fine. Yes, this is what I am talking about when I think about ethical, non-ethical. What are we actually doing? Are we aborting because we receive a diagnosis that is not one hundred percent accurate? But again, this is not known.

The most frequent reasons or motivation for these routine pregnancy check-ups with ultrasounds come from doctors' threats like, "Oh my! Aren't you afraid of having an ectopic pregnancy?" That ectopic pregnancy is only two percent of all cases. What does ectopic mean? It means that the embryo, well, the cells that are supposed to develop and become embryos, meet at fertilization around this area, after which they roll and reach through the tubes, into the uterus and the endometrial wall. This usually happens in the first seven days after conception. However, because it happens, and we will talk about these moments when the embryo does not reach the uterus but remains somehow on a tube, it starts to grow in the tube, widening the tube and causing a rupture. So, the fear of ectopic pregnancy is very big, but in fact, it represents only two percent. Of course, when you are there, in that two percent, it is clearly no joy.

Now, there are emotional causes for which this embryo does not reach the uterus. Because, yes, we, with our thoughts, with the conflicts generated by our thoughts, can block certain very important functions of our body. So, an emotional cause for an ectopic pregnancy can be that I want the pregnancy, but I am afraid. And this fear blocks the tubes, narrows them, and somehow the embryo does not manage to reach the uterus on the seventh day, but remains blocked on the tube. Or, ectopic pregnancy also happens when my child has no place in my home. My home, in quotes, is the uterus. So, if I do not feel comfortable and do not feel that I have my own place to offer safety and security to my child, yes, at that moment, it is clear that the embryo may not reach the uterus. In the case of sexual abuse where my property has been stolen, again, it is about place or what people will say, because this is another very important thing related to place and the judgment related to the baby. These are usually conflicts related to shame and reputation, to a secret. Again, secrets are very important and it is absolutely necessary to get rid of secrets. Or it can be an inadequate partner, a time that is not right, and a place that is not what it should be, an inappropriate place. So, if you know you have such emotional conflicts, yes, there are chances that the pregnancy will not implant exactly where it should. And it is very interesting that, indeed, women who have had an ectopic pregnancy have confirmed one of these emotional causes as being, uh, of quite high intensity.

Let's see what the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are, because most women will say: "Okay, but if I don't go for an ultrasound, how do I know if I have a problem or not?" Well, first of all, you will have pain or sensitivity in the pelvic area. Then there will be vaginal bleeding, possibly with clots, then you will feel pain on one side of the abdomen, like in peritonitis, because the tubes are on one side or the other, that is, left or right. When you have fainting, acute nausea—not just vomiting, not just nausea or heartburn, but vomiting, yes? Fainting. Then it is clearly an ectopic pregnancy. Pain in the shoulders, cervical area, or rectal area. Shock with extremely low blood pressure and unbearable abdominal cramps. Then, clearly, call the ambulance and rush to the hospital, because, in any case, with any of these symptoms, go to the hospital. Do not, uh, do not stay at home, clearly, because these things are not normal or natural in a pregnancy.

Now, there are three simple steps so you don't run straight to the ultrasound. First, resolve your fear, because this fear of ectopic pregnancy—you need to see what conflicts you have behind it. Then you can do Beta HCG blood tests, exactly as I explained in a previous video, which are done every forty-eight hours, and if they do not double, you can do a pelvic examination and, yes, then you can request an ultrasound examination to be sure. For such cases, ultrasounds are indicated, because this investigation, um, this is what it is for, yes? To see if there are problems. But ultrasounds are not for taking a cute picture with the baby, because that is not what ultrasounds are for.

Nuchal translucency, which is scheduled, yes, as a test starting at week eleven. Again, this nuchal translucency is a guaranteed subscription to weekly ultrasounds if the doctor plays dirty. Now, most doctors, to get more consultations, will tell all sorts of things: that if it does not show that the nuchal translucency is exactly this part at the back of the baby's neck, which must be a certain thickness. They say that when it is thicker, it is abnormal, and when it is like this, it is okay. Nineteen out of twenty babies considered at high risk for Down syndrome will be perfectly healthy after birth, but the mother will live her pregnancy with unnecessary worries and dark thoughts, believing her child has a problem.

So, I just want to tell you this: as long as the baby is in a full process of creation, it is almost impossible to correctly assess its developmental state, because we are not robots, we do not have... benchmarks that are valid for everyone. Because you can't. Because not all children are the same. So, it is not normal to wait for the final result and not get emotional and stressed at every test, yes? Because most of the time, these things are not one hundred percent accurate. So, this test, yes, I can say that it induces a lot of fear and makes the woman create a fantastic emotional rupture between herself and the baby in the womb.

What does ultrasound actually do? Besides driving the woman crazy? It tests for fetal anomalies, diagnoses from the position of an observer, so with an accuracy of only thirty percent, so seventy percent of the time we are wrong. Only thirty percent is true there. If the ultrasound gives you such a diagnosis, only thirty percent is accurate, but you do not know this, it makes you choose between terminating or keeping the pregnancy. That is why I say that ultrasound in pregnancy, which is done so lightly in Romania, is not a routine test and should not be treated as a game or amusement, because for that mother who goes and tests her child, it is a bad movie, in which she is effectively waiting for problems and anomalies.

And as I said, if the doctor has, let's say, an interest in playing dirty, you will get all sorts of "Let's see next week, because I don't like something." Well, if you hear that, the woman is at the door on the third day, crying, can't take it anymore. Yes, she needs to see if it's better. And there are many doctors who do this, unfortunately. I also know extraordinary doctors who would never do this, but I have seen that, unfortunately, it is not always the case.

Ultrasound represents a major risk in the first trimester of pregnancy. Yes, I know, it sounds terrible and it is, because tests confirm this. There are tests done on animals and tests done on humans. What has been seen in tests, ultrasound causes mass cell death. Considering that the embryo is a bunch of cells, we greatly disrupt the development of the child. You should know that many miscarriages before twelve weeks happen because of too many ultrasound investigations. What else does ultrasound do? It affects the formation of chorionic villi. That is, it affects the formation of the placenta. The placenta forms in the first trimester of pregnancy and will become active around the second trimester. Until then, the baby is nourished differently. But we will talk about this in the appropriate course. What else does ultrasound do? It necroses mitochondria and alters DNA. Yes, I know, it sounds freaking. That is exactly what it is. It affects the internal cellular structure, leads to generalized inflammation in the embryo, which leads to a possible miscarriage, because the embryo cannot develop optimally, and the woman's body senses this and will reduce the hormones that support the pregnancy. Yes, as I said, unfortunately, miscarriages also come from these exaggerations.

Let me give just one example: in any country outside Romania, more to the west, in Western Europe, only two, maximum three, ultrasound tests are done. Usually, the woman comes after twelve weeks, when the embryo is already formed and all systems are formed, and another test is done, if everything is okay, around thirty-four, thirty-five weeks. Simply, that's it. There is no need for month by month, or week by week. That is madness, because, unfortunately, no one controls this frequency.

Returning to babies in the womb who are wrongly diagnosed as having serious anomalies such as Down syndrome or autism, you should know that I have encountered dozens of cases where mothers were recommended to abort at four, five, or six months. And believe me, such a decision is very hard to make, it is almost impossible. Some mothers who refused that abortion discovered at birth, to their astonishment, that the baby was perfectly healthy. But how did that woman live her pregnancy? In what way did that woman live her pregnancy, believing that at the end of the pregnancy she would meet a baby with problems? Yes, unfortunately, this Nocebo effect is not counted by anyone. Yes? When the baby actually lives the mother's emotions. When babies in the womb are diagnosed in this wrong way, you should know that there are even medical studies showing that only one in two hundred children diagnosed with serious problems was aborted for nothing. How can you tell a mother that? Because she can't handle it. And there are not few cases where the woman, after being forced to make such a decision, uh, has an autopsy and finds that the baby actually had neither Down syndrome nor autism, but was aborted because these tests, which are only thirty percent accurate, said some things. Yes, it is very painful and too few people talk about this. I know very few doctors who know about this and who say it is not okay to do so many ultrasounds.

So, I want to give you some recommendations for the shortest possible scans. A short scan means two to three minutes, because in two to three minutes you have seen everything you need to see. You do not need an hour to keep the ultrasound on the baby, for what? To drive him crazy, to put him in a chart, to measure his little bones and femur length and elbow length? There is no need. And—(coughs)—excuse me. And it doesn't make sense, because what chart is that which is generally valid? So, scans can be short, two to three minutes. The most recommended scans are those at the lowest possible intensity, that is, at as few MHz as possible. That is why I do not recommend those color or video images, or 4D or 5D. Do the shortest possible scans, even if you go to a more advanced ultrasound machine, you can ask the sonographer to do scans at the lowest possible intensity. Why? The lower the intensity, the less it disrupts the baby. And if the doctor insists on doing scans, yes? Ultrasound scans, ask him why you should do that scan. To see what? To tell you to abort? Maybe you can tell him, "Doctor, I do not wish to abort, because this child chose me to be his mother, and that's it. Period." So then, why scan? Let him answer this question, and then you can ask another question: what are the options, can we do something concrete, besides abortion? Because the chances or, well, the options are these: we keep the child or abort. There are not many other options. In utero interventions, that is, during pregnancy, are very few and very few doctors get involved. Usually, everyone waits until the baby comes and everything is fine.

Also, ask your doctor what the error margin of the scan is. If he answers thirty percent, he is telling you the tested truth. If he says forty percent, then yes, he knows. And if he says there is no error in the scan, then he has no idea. And ask him one more thing, if he says he wants to see how big the baby is. Ask him, what is the error margin for weighing, because that error margin is up to seven hundred grams. In the end, what does it matter how big the baby is? Because in the next lessons I will show you that weight does not matter, but rather the length of the child, over which the weight is distributed. But yes, we will also talk about the cord around the neck and about how big the baby is and how the head should be and how small, or—but all these things are not necessary to know in advance, because they will simply adapt at birth.

So, inform yourself beforehand and do not follow the crowd, because you might regret it and it might not be what you want for your child. Thank you and see you in the next lesson.
