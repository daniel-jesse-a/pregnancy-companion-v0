Hello, my dear, and I am glad to see you again at a course about breastfeeding. Today I will talk to you about the microbiome, what the microbiome means, and why it is so important for this microbiome to be transferred from mother to baby through breastfeeding. I will tell you what breast milk actually is. We will talk about oligosaccharides in breast milk, about the brain in the stomach, because we have a second brain in our stomach. Figuratively, of course. I will tell you about the enemies of the human microbiome, about what formula milk contains, and that this formula milk has always been a human experiment. Umm, we’ll discuss a bit about colic in babies and formula milk, the history of formula milk implementation on the market, and the current disastrous situation of breastfeeding worldwide, not just here. Welcome to this breastfeeding course! Breastfeeding is the most important transfer of health from mother to baby. You probably already know from my courses that breast milk is what gives your baby antibodies, antibodies that they are not born with and will receive from the mother through breast milk for two years. The mother is the baby’s world, their safety, their everything. A baby without a mother knows they cannot survive, and that’s why I will tell you more in my live courses with me that babies, when, let’s say, the mother is not prepared and not committed, babies somehow become desperate saviors of their mothers. Why? Because they know they will not survive without their mother’s arms, without her milk, without the safety that only the mother can provide. That’s why, let’s say, the first hours after birth are crucial. Because if the baby does not feel welcomed and does not continue to feel the mother, but is separated from her, they will experience traumas that will follow them for life. Traumas that we, as adults, are now trying to heal from our own births.

How is breast milk formed? What is breast milk, really? Breast milk is a kind of essentialization of the mother. That is, the best of a mother’s body, which produces a complex and complete lactation secretion. So it’s as if the mother is distilling herself to give the baby everything they need. What is milk made of? Breast milk is actually filtered blood from the mother, only it is not red. And this breast milk contains nutritional and non-nutritional elements; the nutritional elements are those that the child digests and assimilates, while the non-nutritional elements do not feed the child but actually feed the child’s digestive microbes. What are the nutritional elements in breast milk? They are lactose, lipids, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The non-nutritional elements, which actually feed the digestive microbes, are oligosaccharides, cells, immunoglobulins, enzymes, cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. That’s why formula milk can never replace breast milk, because it does not contain those non-nutritional elements for the child, but for the digestive microbes. That’s why humanity has not succeeded in reproducing a baby milk that could ever replace breast milk. There are digestive microbes—and don’t think of something bad, but something that exists in us—these bacteria need oligosaccharides, cells, immunoglobulins, enzymes, cytokines, and growth factors, plus hormones that they receive from breast milk. The rest of the nutritional elements pass into the child’s digestive system precisely because of these bacteria, which also need their own food, not just to allow the nutritional elements to pass into the baby’s body. This is scientifically proven. There are studies. The human microbiome must be transferred from mother to baby. This is transferred only through breast milk. That’s why it is very important for a woman to breastfeed her child from the first seconds of life, that is, in the first half hour of life, the child will reach the breast, will crawl up by themselves.

Now, there are three types of milk. Which are actually the same milk, but come in three stages. Breast milk is alive and full of antibodies. The first milk the mother has immediately, a few seconds after birth and even before birth, as I told you in the other course, a woman starts lactation around the 16th week of pregnancy. So, after birth, the first milk that flows from the breast is colostrum. Colostrum, which is the most concentrated and therefore comes in very small amounts, drop by drop, and this colostrum flows for about two to three days at most, after which this orange-yellow milk turns into a more whitish milk. It is called transitional milk, and then on the fourth or fifth day it turns into mature milk. After that, a woman can breastfeed for years with this mature milk, which also comes in stages. When the child wants to drink milk from the mother, the first milk that comes is to quench their thirst. That’s why, for example, in summer, when it’s hotter, babies, infants, do not need water, tea, or other Romanian remedies, but only need the mother and her milk, because the milk is sufficient and perfect to quench their thirst. So, in summer, the baby, to avoid reaching the second stage of milk, which comes after the thirst-quenching one, will drink little but often. So, every time they latch onto the breast, the child will drink a little, because they are thirsty. After this thirst-quenching milk comes the fattier milk, which satisfies hunger. Let’s say it’s the second course, plus dessert. So, children whose mothers switch breasts too quickly, putting the child first on one breast, then on the other, without waiting for the baby to empty the breast, might only get the initial milk, and then the child might not gain weight properly, because they are only drinking thirst-quenching milk and never reach the fatty milk—the second course—because the mother switches breasts too quickly. So, my dears, it’s very simple, not complicated at all. When you put the child to the breast, let them finish that breast. How do you know the breast is finished? Well, you’ll hear that at some point they no longer swallow when they suck. That is (music) smack-smack-sjack, mmm... You can hear the swallowing. That means there is milk, and the baby is swallowing. When the milk from the breast is finished, from one breast, the child will no longer swallow, just suck. Please watch the other episodes I present about breastfeeding, because there are several in which I explain that the milk never runs out, even if the baby has emptied one or both breasts. That production cycle repeats. So, we could leave the child at the breast for three days or have ten children and breastfeed them all with the same mother. The mother produces enough milk. But yes, in that case, the mother really needs to eat properly, because she needs to regain her strength and replenish her stores to be able to produce so much milk.

Now, what is breast milk? Here you have two images: in the first image, where I have my mouse now, is breast milk. See how it looks. And synthetic formula milk looks (two-second pause noise) different. Very different. Breast milk is more like a tissue than a simple liquid. First of all, it is the cheapest product, the healthiest, which builds your immune system. There is no formula milk that has or contains antibodies. So, no immune system when feeding with formula milk, or a weaker immune system. Producing this breast milk consumes the most energy from the mother. So, when a woman breastfeeds, it’s as if she’s doing sports, because the energy consumption is immense, so exhaustion also comes from this continuous breastfeeding day and night, which is the normal way to feed a baby, but it consumes a lot of the mother’s energy resources. Breast milk does not only feed the child, but also the beneficial bacteria of the human microbiome in the intestines. So the microbiome has its place and headquarters in the intestines. That’s why there are those bacteria that also feed on the nutrients from breast milk. If they only receive formula milk, these beneficial bacteria, which are responsible for digestion, will... will no longer exist in the intestines, and from there come pains, cramps, colic, and so on. So, pay close attention, the first meal a baby must have is breast milk, that is, colostrum, exactly the milk that somehow prepares the newborn’s digestion and feeds these beneficial bacteria of the human microbiome, which are in the intestinal area.

Breastfeeding positions are very simple. You need pillows or comfortable support, because you will be sitting for hours. To breastfeed. Here, this will be the first breastfeeding position. After you have given birth, your child will be placed on your chest, if you request it, of course, because if not... Standard procedures are not like this. So, it may be that in the first, let’s say, month or two or a few weeks after birth, you will only be able to breastfeed in this position, because you will sleep with the baby in your arms non-stop. Don’t think the baby sleeps in their own bed and you’ll have this thing where they sleep every time you go out with them. These are myths. What actually happens? You will sleep non-stop with the baby, they will be in your bed, because that is natural. Because if you start to stress and traumatize them from a young age, it doesn’t help you or them. So, the most comfortable option when you want to breastfeed is clearly sleeping with the baby, which is also natural. After that, I recommend you get a pillow and you can breastfeed under your arm or in front of you. And after two or three months, after the baby starts to understand that this is how they get food and gets used to breastfeeding, you will be able to breastfeed lying down. For example, I breastfed for four and a half years and then I breastfed lying down. Only in the first two months, until we got used to each other, did I sit up and put the baby on pillows to put them to the breast. After that, I would simply turn from one side to the other and move the baby from one breast to the other, almost sleeping. And everyone was happy. In the morning, we woke up more or less rested, even if we woke up every half hour or every hour. The baby does not have a sleep schedule. Just so you understand, there is no training course, because you cannot train a baby. The baby needs to suck and stay close to the mother’s breast.

What I want to show you here is how not to do it, because in these pictures, probably just for demonstration, the baby is placed on the back of the armchair, or the woman holds them with one hand. Believe me, when you sit for two hours, as you will be sitting non-stop, you cannot hold the baby. Even if you had the muscles of a weightlifter, it’s not possible. It will break your back if you sit leaning over. No, you cannot breastfeed like that. So, the position in which you will breastfeed after the first two months will be this: lying down. Because you can experiment with this position, let’s say, after the first two months of adapting to your new superpower—the superpower of raising and breastfeeding your child and transferring that microbiome and antibodies for a super strong immune system. Ideal breastfeeding pillows are large, not very soft, but very firm, which you can also use for sleeping. And later, when the baby starts to sit up, as support. So, the breastfeeding pillow, you clearly need it because it is useful. Who can breastfeed? Well, even an adoptive mother, a grandmother in menopause, and even a man can breastfeed, because lactation or relactation is very possible. It’s not that... I’m with the LGBT or the new trend, yes, misunderstood or, anyway, a madness. Men don’t have to give birth, men don’t have to breastfeed, but I just want to tell you that even men—a man has mammary glands which, if stimulated by a baby, will produce milk. When did this happen? Well, in countries like India or in Asia, it happened that the mother died at birth and the father, raising his child, putting them and keeping them on his chest, the child found the nipple, latched on, and started to suck, and, well, the father allowed this to happen because he realized it was a need, and milk was actually formed even in a man. I’m not saying this as a suggestion, it’s not the case, but through this I want to show you that even a grandmother who is in menopause can breastfeed, even a mother who did not give birth to her child and only adopted them can breastfeed successfully. But, indeed, it takes patience and, let’s say, a lactation consultant, IBCLC, who can show you how to use an SNS and how to put the baby to the breast so that they suck, stimulate the breast to produce lactation in you, even if you haven’t given birth. And through that little tube that goes alongside your nipple into the baby’s mouth, breast milk can flow, which you probably received from another breastfeeding mother. So, theoretically and practically, you can breastfeed. There is no reason for there to be, let’s say, an incapacity to breastfeed, because any mother who gave birth to her child, even if she didn’t give birth to them, can breastfeed. So, it is not an impossible mission. You just need the right information and people who support you. And the people who support you are not usually other mothers or people who have succeeded or not succeeded. They are actually certified lactation consultants. Those who, as I told you, follow Jack Newman, IBCLC, that is, International Board of Lactation Consultants. There are many in Romania in most major cities, so you can definitely find a list of them and look for one in advance, because you don’t look for a lactation consultant after you give birth, but before, because you will want to meet. You will want to ask if there are any problems, if you have inverted nipples or not. So, clearly, a discussion with a lactation consultant before you give birth is very important.

What is the diet of a breastfeeding mother? As in pregnancy, the food must be nutritious, healthy. I say fifty percent raw, fifty percent thermally processed. Why? To have an intake of minerals, vitamins, living things, and the food to be as natural and varied as possible. To have milk, believe me, you don’t need to drink teas or magic potions. You don’t need beer or other things. Of course, during breastfeeding we avoid cigarettes, alcohol, and other medications, vaccines, and other toxins or drugs, because the milk is produced from the woman’s plasma and it is not something you assimilate by drinking animal milk or eating a certain thing. There are indeed foods that produce lactation and foods that, let’s say, do not influence lactation. The important thing is for you to maintain a hormonal balance to produce oxytocin, which, together with prolactin, actually produces that transformation from plasma to milk. So, you don’t need anything. You don’t need to drink teas. You don’t need to follow a diet, don’t let me catch you making compotes and eating only boiled foods. These are super outdated. The child, you don’t cause colic if you eat, for example, salad or something nutritious or alive. Not at all. So, please, don’t get your information from mommy groups, because you might be disappointed and get rather outdated and totally false advice.

Breast milk is more than food. It is a personalized composition, it is living food, it helps the neurological and cognitive development of the brain. It is the child’s immune system. It fights viral infections, contains stem cells, contains epithelial cells, and transfers the mother’s microbiome to the child. That’s why it is highly recommended not to overload yourself with antibiotics, because the microbiome suffers because of this.

Let’s see what this microbiome is and, first of all, what the oligosaccharides in breast milk are. Because we talked at the beginning about nutritional and non-nutritional substances. Non-nutritional does not mean they are not good. The child does not use them directly for nourishment. But those oligosaccharides are part of those non-nutritional substances that are consumed by intestinal bacteria to form good, perfect digestion, actually, which works, and oligosaccharides are actually the third most abundant component of breast milk, which prepare digestion and eighty percent of the child’s health. Well, let’s see what oligosaccharides are. They facilitate the growth and development of beneficial microbes. So, microbes and beneficial bacteria exist in every human body. The baby needs breast milk to form this microbiome, which actually means beneficial bacteria and microbes for digestion. What do these oligosaccharides in breast milk do? They reduce the risk of infection, reduce the risk of allergies or asthma, help proper cognitive development, reduce the risk of diabetes or obesity, and reduce the risk of intestinal inflammation. So, the oligosaccharides in milk, which the child does not use for nourishment, actually help create the microbiome, which is actually (pause) your child’s health.

We are born without an immune system, so very vulnerable, almost sterile. Almost, because we are not completely sterile, but coming from a uterine environment, we do not have all, let’s say, the components that a human body should have, but we still need additional colonization. At birth, we must colonize ourselves with the mother’s vaginal bacteria and the bacteria from breast milk, that is, those from colostrum, to be prepared for life outside the uterus. So, the conclusion is that a child born by cesarean section will not be colonized with vaginal bacteria, but has the chance, if the mother knows and if the mother does not separate from the child and if the mother receives the child in the first seconds at the breast and in thirty minutes after birth puts them to suckle, then the child has the chance to be colonized with these bacteria that we need in the intestine, through colostrum, that is, the first milk, that orange-golden one that comes.

Now, what does the microbiome of the child, the baby, the newborn mean? First of all, the microbiome can be formed depending on several things. These requirements (three-second pause) we all have, and depending on how the woman lives her pregnancy and then how she gives birth, this microbiome will form well or deficiently. For example, if the mother lives in a rather toxic environment, smokes, or has digestive problems, if she eats unbalanced, eats foods that are not good, that are very acidic, yes, if she takes medication, if she overloads on antibiotics. The human microbiome matters a lot. Then, the human microbiome, of course, is easier to form in a child born at term and will be a bit more difficult for a premature baby. The way of birth also influences the microbiome, because if we are born by cesarean section, we are not colonized with vaginal bacteria. If we are born vaginally, we have every chance to be colonized with the mother’s vaginal bacteria, which help us prepare our digestion for ingesting breast milk. What is also transferred from the mother is her own intestinal microbiome. That’s why you will now understand why nature created us in such a way that we are born in a place where we encounter that, let’s say, the mother’s microbiome. That’s why we are not born in this area, that is, to vomit the child, but we are born through the vagina. The vagina is located next to the anus, and the anus is already colonized with the woman’s microbiome, which it contains. So it is absolutely normal for the baby to encounter these bacteria, which are perfectly normal to be there. For example, other mammals have a behavior that may seem strange to a human, but the elephant, for example, the elephant mother, after giving birth to her baby, defecates above the child. It’s probably, as they say, you didn’t eat shit when you were little, that’s why you didn’t have luck. The idea is that we don’t have to do this, but there are always... There are microscopic things or bacteria that are anyway near the vaginal opening, being very close to the anus. So there is no need to do this like elephants do. Please do not misinterpret me, because I only gave you an example to understand how mammals do and that the fact that we are born near the anus is absolutely normal. And biological. That is, we need those bacteria to develop our human microbiome. So a child who does not have the chance to be born naturally and is born in a sterile field, by cesarean section, will be colonized with whatever is in the area where they are born. That is, a sterile field means they will probably be colonized with the bacteria and microbes they find in that hospital environment. That’s why so many children leave the maternity with streptococci and all kinds of monsters and brontosaurs. It’s another discussion here, but because they are not placed skin-to-skin on the mother. And here we even have an image with the microbiome that is created from colonization with the bacteria found on the mother’s skin. That’s why it is said that, when we give birth, the magic hour must take place skin-to-skin on the mother or father. Why? Because from them we will take the bacteria in which we will live. That is, we will live in their house, we will live in their environment. The mother colonizes me with the bacteria from her skin, precisely so that I can survive as a baby. After that, it matters a lot whether the child is breastfed or if their first meal was formula milk, because again, some steps are skipped. So these aspects are very important so that you choose what is right for your child.

Let’s see who the enemies of the human microbiome are. First of all, the enemies are antibiotics taken during pregnancy by the mother, which are transferred, of course, to the baby, because that’s how it is. They don’t remain only in the mother’s body, because everything the mother ingests goes and passes through the placenta to the child. So, the more antibiotics you have taken, the better it would be not to give anyone the chance to give you antibiotics, because they affect the human microbiome. The enemies of the human microbiome are also cesarean operations, especially when they are not necessary. And in Romania, ninety percent of cesareans are elective, meaning they do not have a medical indication. Many doctors perform cesareans out of convenience, because a cesarean takes twenty, at most twenty-five minutes, and you can schedule several in a day, whereas with a natural birth you don’t know when it starts and when it ends. So yes, it’s a business issue here. But even with a cesarean operation, this colonization with the mother’s vaginal bacteria can be done additionally. So, in civilized countries like Europe, England, America, there are hospitals and maternities where a woman who has to give birth by cesarean and knows these things can request vaginal colonization with her bacteria. And it’s very simple. The doctors, before the operation, insert a sterile tampon into the mother’s vagina, which after birth is removed and the baby is smeared on the face with the mother’s vaginal secretions, especially around the nose, mouth, even in the mouth, on the throat, and then on the skin. But the best option is this colonization with vaginal bacteria, and after that the child, who should not be taken anywhere, should not even be wiped, but should be placed directly skin-to-skin on the mother, precisely to achieve the rest of the colonization with the bacteria from the mother’s skin.

Another serious and difficult enemy is formula or synthetic milk. It is a synthetic milk, with many things in it that do not belong there. And now, why is this formula or synthetic milk called a great human experiment? Because, honestly, (sighs) we have not studied enough what the consequences are of the fact that most children born in the last fifty or sixty years have been fed formula instead of human milk? What does formula milk not contain? It does not contain oligosaccharides, which you now know feed the human microbiome. It does not contain antibodies. It does not contain immunomodulatory components. It does not contain anti-inflammatory components. And it does not contain elements that favor digestion, metabolism, or cognitive development. So we have a big problem, because that’s why I think today’s children are very sick. Today’s children all have colic, yes? Because yes, if the immune system and digestive system are not helped with this microbiome, then digestion will not be good and nothing works as it should. So the microbiome must somehow be facilitated at birth, through breastfeeding, and so on.

Let’s see what formula milk contains. And here I have put some pictures, not to advertise that these are the worst or the best. Formula milk, in general, cannot contain what breast milk contains. You already understand why. The problem is that this formula milk increases acidity in the body artificially. Why? Because of the sugars, it also produces instant coagulation, thus favoring the appearance of colic. What happens with formula milk after, let’s say, we made the bottle with warm water because, well, the baby drinks warm or lukewarm milk. Umm, after it cools, formula milk becomes like gelatin, and this gelatin is very hard to digest for the baby’s stomach, which has just started, because the stomach starts at the first, let’s say, feeding of the child. In the mother’s womb, there was no need for the stomach to digest and assimilate the food received from the placenta directly into the bloodstream, through the umbilical cord.

So, let’s see what formula milk contains. Formula milk is actually an animal protein from hydrolyzed cow’s milk. It contains emulsifiers, sugars. And now I want to amaze you. So you understand that, well, we sometimes have a no-sugar diet. Think that a child from birth to the age of 5, if fed with formula and with what the Ministry of Health and the minister and everyone dealing with human health recommends, receives a ton and a half of sugar from birth to the age of five. It contains maltodextrin, a rather controversial food additive. It is used especially in bodybuilding, yes, as a kind of, um, doping. I don’t know what to call it. It also contains taurine—taurine, which we find in energy drinks, yes, like RedBull or, I don’t know, Hell or whatever they’re called. They really do what they say on the label. Umm, starch, which suddenly raises blood sugar, and then, maybe, who knows, we analyze our child and see they have diabetes. Well, yes, because we give them starch. Dietary fibers that do not appear on the label. Vegetable oils, without mentioning the type and extraction method, by the way, about cold-pressed extra virgin oil. Those vegetable oils, a kind of margarine, yes? Umm, whey and cow’s lactose. I’ve told you before that humans are not, do not belong to the animal species, even if they are mammals. But I want you to compare a bit how long it takes for a human baby to grow and how long it takes for a calf, a baby cow, to grow, yes? The calf is an adult in three months. The child in three months is just as much a baby or infant as three months ago. Umm, all kinds of “E” additives. It’s written very small, but I’ve highlighted them for you to understand. Potassium phosphate, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, synthetic vitamins and minerals that the body cannot assimilate or metabolize. They are unassimilable and with 40% more aluminum than allowed. So, if you look closely in a box, all are packed in aluminum. Aluminum, by the way, is the number one cause for our elders’ problems with Alzheimer’s. It’s clear we have too much aluminum in our bodies, so avoid aluminum pots, Teflon pots, aluminum foil, because these contain the most, those with the most aluminum parts.

And here we have the label with the ingredients. For example, I took a formula milk, Humana one, and you find here, indeed, a lot of taurine, yes, so, fluoride. So, you can’t imagine what you’re putting in your child, um, because, yes, it’s written small and everyone thinks, well, formula milk is better than breast milk. I haven’t heard a bigger lie. And by the way, colic appears from feeding with formula, because the baby’s body does not know what and how to digest this formula. Formula, synthetic or otherwise, can favor the following risks: asthma, obesity, diabetes, immune dysfunctions, allergies, slightly slower cognitive growth. So, why is that? Let’s see a bit when this magic, in quotes, formula milk appeared in the history of mankind or breastfeeding. Before 1867, mothers did not know about formula. What you see in the picture are not mothers with their children, but wet nurses. Sixty years ago, there were wet nurses who breastfed other mothers’ children. They went to the maternity and simply, four or five hours a day, breastfed other children, because those children had no mother or something happened to their mothers at birth, or... Yes, there was a situation. When a wet nurse could not be found, the child without a mother was said to be undernourished or malnourished with animal milk. So, first a wet nurse was sought, that is, another woman to give her own breast milk. And the children who were abandoned, orphaned, left alone, were raised with formula. That was the worst option that could be done. Now, when I see how women give up their gold, that is, um, give up this ability to produce breast milk, simply give up, give up informing themselves or knowing or at least trying a bit to see if they can start lactation and resort with the greatest ease to formula, which before was only for orphans and children who, anyway, did not amount to much in society. That’s how formula was seen not long ago, sixty years ago.

And here, when they realized a mega business could be made, um, the history of evaporated milk, because that’s what it was called, or synthetic, um, formula was only for orphaned children, so they wouldn’t starve. But starting in 1950, a super aggressive advertising campaign began and they managed, from a pariah thing that was only given to those who would die anyway, to... Advertising sells anything, right? Here’s Nestle. Look a bit at what kind of water you drink, how you drink, what you drink, what kind of products you eat, and you’ll see that Nestle bought half the planet. So, mmm, how does a lying advertisement start? For example, “No doctor can recommend any better evaporated milk for infant feeding.” So, no doctor can recommend better evaporated milk than formula for, um, feeding babies. Umm, so profits increased. Baby malnutrition started then. And now, yes, we are witnessing the biggest, let’s say, human experiment related to what will happen or how children raised with formula will evolve. Don’t jump on me, I’m just telling you what it is. I’m glad if you managed to breastfeed or I’m glad you managed to feed your children with formula. The idea is to be careful, um, and start to care more about the child’s diet, because formula is not what they want you to believe.

The percentage of mothers who breastfeed is, unfortunately, getting smaller. Only forty-three percent worldwide still breastfeed. New generations are increasingly sickly and fragile, because formula does not provide immunity. The immunity they receive, inherited from the mother through breast milk. See, the green countries are the countries where exclusive breastfeeding still happens. And we have reached the point where only in India is breastfeeding still common. And in African peoples. Or far away, somewhere in Indonesia, Japan, or South America. Elsewhere, it’s a disaster—under twenty percent, as you see here in darker pink, breastfeeding happens. So, it’s terrible what, yes, it’s clear there will be repercussions on future generations. It’s already visible, um, how hard and how sick the children of these newer generations are. Thank you, and see you at the next breastfeeding course, where I will teach you many more things.
